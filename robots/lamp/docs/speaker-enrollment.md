# Speaker Voice Enrollment — Technical Spec

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (2026-04)

## Overview

Lamp identifies who is speaking via **WeSpeaker ResNet34** (256-dim embedding, ONNX Runtime). When a speaker is not recognized, HAL saves the audio and optionally nudges the AI agent to enroll the voice. Enrollment is **self-service only** — each person enrolls their own voice.

## Anti-Spam Gates

Four layers prevent the agent from repeatedly asking "who are you?":

| Layer | Where | Gate | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| **Audio duration** | HAL `_internal/speaker_decorate.py` | `duration_s < SPEAKER_MIN_AUDIO_S` (0.8s) | Skip recognition entirely for very short audio |
| **Enroll instruction** | HAL `_should_request_speaker_enroll()` | `≥ 10 words AND ≥ 2s audio` | Don't append full enroll instruction for short utterances (short variant with multi-turn combine hint is still sent) |
| **Lamp-side nudge cooldown** | Lamp `domain/voice.go` | `5 min since last nudge` | Don't inject SKILL.md instruction more than once per 5 min |
| **Per-voiceprint nudge cooldown** | HAL `_internal/speaker_decorate.py` | `30 min per voiceprint_hash` (`HAL_ENROLL_NUDGE_COOLDOWN_S`) | Don't repeat "ask user's name" for the same unknown voice cluster; plain `Unknown Speaker:` message sent instead |

## Model & Embedding

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | WeSpeaker ResNet34 (VoxCeleb trained) |
| Embedding dim | 256 |
| Runtime | ONNX Runtime (CPU) on perception-service (RunPod) |
| Endpoint | `POST {DL_BACKEND_URL}/lelamp/api/dl/audio-recognizer/embed` |
| Auth | `X-API-Key` header |
| Timeout | 15s |

### Recognition Algorithm

1. Audio → **on-device** preprocess on HAL (`Mono → Resample → [HighPass] → [NoiseReduce] → VAD → [STOI] → RMS`). Clips that fail the VAD/STOI/quality gate are rejected locally (treated as "unknown") and **never uploaded**.
2. Cleaned WAV → `POST /audio-recognizer/embed` with `preprocess=false` **and `use_sliding_window=true`**; the server skips its own preprocessing and slides overlapping windows to return per-chunk embeddings `[M, 256]` (a clip ≤ ~10 s stays a single window)
3. Cosine similarity against all enrolled speaker embeddings
4. Per-chunk voting: each chunk votes for its closest match
5. Winner = most votes (tiebreak by average confidence)
6. `confidence ≥ 0.7` → match; else unknown

> **Enroll differs:** enrollment calls the same endpoint with **`use_sliding_window=false`**, so the server embeds the **whole** reference utterance in a single shot (one `[256]` vector, no windowing/mean) — stored as one row per WAV in the speaker bank. Recognition then votes its windowed query chunks against those single-shot enrollment vectors (both live in the same L2-normalized space).

### Audio preprocessing (on-device)

The filter/VAD/normalize pipeline that used to run inside perception-service now runs on HAL, next to the mic — the same processors in the same order, ported to `hal/drivers/voice/speaker_recognizer/audio_processors/` (mirrors `AudioProcessorFactory` in perception-service). This keeps rejected audio off the network and puts the gate decision on the device.

- **Default chain**: `MonoConverter → Resampler(16k) → VoiceActivityFilter(TEN-VAD) → SpeechIntelligibilityFilter(0.70) → RMSNormalizer(0.1)`. `HighPassFilter` and `NoiseReducer` exist but are **off by default** (same as perception).
- **VAD gate** (TEN-VAD via the vendored `hal/drivers/voice/ten_vad_lite/`): trims leading/trailing non-voice and rejects a clip when it removes all speech, the remaining audio is `< 0.5s`, or the voice ratio is `< 0.25`. A rejected clip raises `PreprocessRejected` → HAL returns "unknown" for recognize and skips the sample for enroll — exactly the behavior it had when perception returned HTTP 400.
- **Why TEN-VAD, not silero**: this stage ran the torch `silero-vad` package until it was swapped for TEN-VAD's ~300 KB FP32 ONNX model, run on numpy + onnxruntime (both already HAL deps — the original model only; no quantized build ships). Same class, same constructor, same reject reasons, so the rest of the pipeline is untouched. It takes **torch off this path**: +43 MB for import + model load instead of +170 MB, ~27x faster cold start, and onnxruntime has aarch64 wheels where upstream TEN-VAD's prebuilt `libten_vad` has no Linux-arm64 build at all. TEN-VAD is 16 kHz-only, which the `Resampler` upstream already guarantees.
- **False-positive gates** (no silero equivalent): a **speaker-band** gate keeps only VAD frames inside the clip's own pitch band, and a **level** gate drops frames more than 20 dB below the clip's own speech level. They matter because the filter keeps *first speech sample to last*, so one late false positive on a door or a tap drags all the silence before it into the clip. Together they raise the share of the kept span that is really speech from ~0.67 to ~0.79, at a real recall cost (0.98 → 0.76) — the right trade for a recogniser, where a clean 2 s beats a dirty 6 s. They assume **one dominant speaker per clip**: a background talker is removed (usually desirable, it would pollute the embedding), but so would a genuine quieter second speaker. Because they also cut non-speech from *inside* the span, the voice ratio drops mechanically — which is why the min voice ratio moved from `0.4` to `0.25`. Set `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_SPEAKER_BAND=false` and `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_MAX_LEVEL_DROP_DB=` (empty) for plain TEN-VAD.
- **STOI gate** (`SpeechIntelligibilityFilter`, reference-free SQUIM-OBJECTIVE STOI) — **off by default**, `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_STOI=true` to enable: runs **after VAD, before RMS**. Scores the trimmed clip in 5 s chunks and **mean**-aggregates, then rejects when the mean STOI is `< 0.70` (a NaN chunk from silence also rejects), raising `PreprocessRejected(reason="low_intelligibility")` → the same audio-level reject path as VAD (recognize → "unknown", enroll → skip the sample, keeping existing on-disk samples). The ONNX estimator (~20 MB, downloaded on first use from the CDN into `/root/local/models/squimm_stoi.onnx` — see `audio_processors/model_store.py`, same convention as the pose/faceid weights — onnxruntime CPU with the mem-arena off) loads once as a lazy singleton alongside TEN-VAD and only runs after VAD passes — at most once per utterance. If the weight can't be resolved (unreachable CDN / unknown filename) the gate is skipped with a warning (no crash).
- **Server flag**: HAL sends `preprocess=false`; perception's `/embed` is embed-only and now defaults to `preprocess=false` too (HAL is the only caller). A caller that uploads raw audio can pass `preprocess=true` to have the server clean it.
- **Consistency**: enroll and recognize share this one pipeline, so enrollments made after the move stay self-consistent. Voices enrolled under the **old server-side** pipeline should be re-enrolled if match quality drops.

### Embedding-model version tracking & migration

A stored embedding is only comparable to a query embedding produced by the **same** server model. If the perception-service embedding model is swapped, every previously-stored vector silently becomes meaningless to compare against — cosine similarity still returns a number, so the failure is a **wrong match**, not an error. HAL guards against this by stamping each profile with the model identity and re-embedding when it changes. Because every enrollment WAV is retained on disk, this is an automatic background job — no user has to re-record.

- **Model identity**: perception's `/audio-recognizer/embed` response (and `/health`) return `embed_model_version` — `<model-name>:<sha256(weights)[:12]>`, computed once when the model loads. `<model-name>` is the `AUDIO_EMBEDDER__MODEL` config value (`resnet293` / `resnet34` / `campplus` / `ecapa-tdnn1024`), e.g. `resnet293:1a2b3c4d5e6f`. Hashing the weights file catches even a **same-dimension checkpoint swap** that the `embedding_dim` check would miss. Only the model is fingerprinted; the on-device preprocessing config is deliberately **not** part of it.
- **On enroll**: HAL always takes the freshest version seen from that enroll's `/embed` calls and writes it to the voice `metadata.json` as `embed_model_version` (mirrored into the registry).
- **On recognize**: after embedding the query (which refreshes the known server version), HAL compares each enrolled profile's stored version against it. Profiles whose version **differs** are **excluded from matching this turn** (so they read as **"unknown"** rather than wrong-matching against old-model vectors, and a dim change can't crash the match), and a one-shot **background** re-embed migration is kicked — single-flight, on a daemon thread, so the recognize turn itself never waits for the re-embed. Fresh profiles match normally in the same call; excluded ones return to normal automatically once the background migration re-embeds them.
- **On HAL restart**: a background thread polls `/health` for the current `audio_embedder_version` (a few retries to cover server boot), cheaply scans profile metadata for staleness **before** loading the heavy preprocessing model, and migrates any stale profiles — so recognition is correct from the first turn.
- **Migration (re-embed)**: for each stale profile, HAL re-embeds **every** retained sample — both the anchor (`sample_*.wav`) and extended (`extended_*.wav`) tiers — under the new model (same `_prepare_wav_for_embedding` → `/embed` path as enroll) and **atomically** overwrites each sample's embedding **sidecar** (`.npy`, temp file + rename); a sample the gate now rejects has its sidecar dropped so no old-model vector survives a same-dimension checkpoint swap. It then updates `embed_model_version` / `embedding_dim` / `updated_at` and invalidates the bank cache. Guarded so only one migration runs at a time, and a concurrent enroll of the **same** profile is now **serialized** against it — enroll's disk-commit takes the same per-user lock. That lock matters because migration rewrites this profile's sidecars (and `metadata.json`) while a concurrent enroll of the same user may be writing the same files — without it the two disk-commits could interleave and leave an inconsistent sample set; `metadata.json`, the only cross-writer file, has its sample counts re-derived from disk on read. Only the disk commit is guarded — the embedding network calls on both sides run lock-free — so at worst an enroll waits for that one profile's re-embed, never the whole migration batch. The commit runs only **after** every sample embedded, so a mid-migration server outage (`EmbeddingAPIUnavailableError`) **halts** cleanly with the profile fully on the old model and is retried on the next recognize or restart.
- **Un-migratable profiles are left stale, never deleted.** A profile HAL cannot re-embed — because it has **no source WAVs** (a legacy `embedding.npy`-only enrollment, or WAVs deleted), or because **every retained WAV is rejected by today's gate** — is left **stale** (excluded from matching) until the person re-enrolls, not removed. An all-rejected profile is almost always the gate config tightening (the WAVs passed it at enroll under the old config), which is reversible, so the profile re-migrates automatically once a sample passes the gate again; and a stored `embedding.npy`/WAV may be the only copy of the enrollment, so a version bump must never destroy it. A stale profile is harmless — it is filtered out of matching and costs only a cheap per-turn check.

### Enrollment Quality

1. Each WAV sample → on-device preprocess (as above) → embedding via perception-service (`preprocess=false`, `use_sliding_window=false` → one whole-utterance vector per sample)
2. Filter by consistency threshold `0.7` (cosine similarity between samples)
3. Aggregate remaining embeddings via weighted average
4. Store L2-normalized vector at `/root/local/users/{name}/voice/embedding.npy`

### Voice Cluster Tracking (`voiceprint_hash`)

Every unknown voice is locally clustered so the server can say "this is the same unknown speaker we heard 3 minutes ago" without needing any backend support. Lets the agent combine multiple short utterances into one enroll call.

1. After embedding the query audio, the recognizer pools per-chunk embeddings into a single L2-normalized vector.
2. Compare against every stored cluster **row**, taking each cluster's best row (raw cosine). A cluster holds several rows — not one averaged centroid — capped by `SPEAKER_MAX_CLUSTER_SAMPLES` (default `3`) and admitted through the same diversity gate the extended tier uses.
3. Match ≥ `SPEAKER_MATCH_COS` (default `0.5` raw — the **same** threshold as known-speaker matching; there is no separate stranger threshold) → reuse existing label `voice_N` and, if the utterance adds something new, append it as another row.
4. No match → allocate new label `voice_{counter}`, append its row to on-disk state.
5. Cap at `HAL_MAX_VOICE_STRANGERS` (default `50`) **clusters** — the oldest whole cluster is evicted and its on-disk directory is deleted with it. (Eviction used to drop only the in-memory centroid, leaving the audio behind forever.)
6. The assigned hash is:
   - returned on the recognize response as `voiceprint_hash: "voice_N"` (null for known speakers)
   - surfaced in the nudge message as `[voice:voice_N]` tag so the skill can correlate turns
   - used to subdir-group the saved WAV (see Storage)

**Model change wipes the cluster store.** Stranger centroids are only comparable to a query from the **same** embedding model — so unlike enrolled profiles (which are *re-embedded* from retained WAVs), the whole stranger store is **wiped** when the model changes. The store is stamped with the model version it was built under (`voice_strangers/version.txt`); before any compare, HAL keeps the store **only when it can prove same-model provenance** — the live server version is known, the store's stamp **equals** it, **and** the stored dim equals the query dim. Anything else — a **missing** stamp, a **different** stamp, or a **different** dim — cannot prove the centroids came from the current model, so HAL drops the in-memory centroids, deletes the `embeds.npy`/`labels.npy` and every on-disk `voice_N/` WAV dir, and re-stamps. (An unstamped store is **never assumed** current: a same-dim checkpoint swap under a different model would otherwise slip through.) When the server reports **no** version at all, HAL falls back to a dim-only guard. `_stranger_counter` is kept **monotonic** so a freshly minted `voice_N` never collides with a leftover dir. Wiping (not re-embedding) is deliberate: strangers are anonymous and short-lived, so re-embedding throwaway clusters isn't worth the network cost.

**Trailing-silence trim**: before the WAV goes to the embedding API, the speaker-ID buffer is truncated at the last speech frame + 200 ms tail. Without this a 3-second utterance ends up as ~5.5 s with ~45% silence, diluting the embedding. Only affects the speaker-ID path — STT still receives the full stream.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Env var | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Match threshold | 0.5 | `SPEAKER_MATCH_COS` | Min **raw** cosine for speaker match; also pairs clips within a multi-sample enroll batch (was `SPEAKER_MATCH_THRESHOLD` = 0.75 scaled; `raw = 2 × scaled − 1`) |
| Diversity | 0.7 | `SPEAKER_DIVERSITY_COS` | Above this a turn duplicates a stored sample → not kept. Redundancy, not identity — must stay above the match threshold |
| Max extended samples | 3 | `SPEAKER_MAX_EXTENDED_SAMPLES` | Auto-collected samples per user. Safety cap: retrieval is max-over-rows, so extra rows lift every speaker's score |
| Max cluster samples | 3 | `SPEAKER_MAX_CLUSTER_SAMPLES` | Rows kept per unknown-voice cluster |
| Extend min duration | 2.0s | `SPEAKER_EXTEND_MIN_DURATION_SEC` | A turn must be this long to earn an extended slot |
| Extend min margin | 0.05 | `SPEAKER_EXTEND_MIN_MARGIN_COS` | ...and must beat the runner-up speaker by this much |
| API timeout | 15s | `SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_API_TIMEOUT_S` | HTTP timeout for embedding API |
| Min audio for recognition | 0.8s | `HAL_SPEAKER_MIN_AUDIO_S` | Skip recognition below this |
| Min words for enroll nudge | 10 | Hardcoded in `_should_request_speaker_enroll()` | Transcript word count gate |
| Min duration for enroll nudge | 2.0s | Hardcoded in `_should_request_speaker_enroll()` | Audio duration gate |
| Lamp nudge cooldown | 5 min | Hardcoded in `domain/voice.go` | Don't re-inject SKILL instruction globally |
| Per-voiceprint nudge cooldown | 30 min | `HAL_ENROLL_NUDGE_COOLDOWN_S` | Don't re-ask name for same voiceprint cluster |
| Voice stranger match threshold | _(shared)_ | `SPEAKER_MATCH_COS` | Reuses the known-speaker match threshold to cluster an unknown voice into an existing `voice_N` — no separate knob |
| Max voice strangers | 50 | `HAL_MAX_VOICE_STRANGERS` | Cluster **count** cap; oldest whole cluster evicted, its audio dir deleted with it |
| Voice strangers dir | `/root/local/voice_strangers` | `HAL_VOICE_STRANGERS_DIR` | Persist cluster embeddings (survives reboot) |
| Speaker recognition enabled | true | `HAL_SPEAKER_RECOGNITION_ENABLED` | Master toggle (default on; gated on the `audio` capability) |

### On-device preprocessing knobs

Mirror perception's `AudioProcessorSetting` defaults; override via env (all prefixed `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_`).

| Parameter | Default | Env var | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Target sample rate | 16000 | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_TARGET_SR` | Resampler target |
| Mono | on | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_MONO` | Downmix to mono |
| Resample | on | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_RESAMPLE` | Resample to target SR |
| High-pass | off | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_HIGH_PASS` / `..._HIGH_PASS_CUTOFF_HZ` (80.0) | Butterworth HPF |
| Noise reduce | off | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_NOISE_REDUCE` / `..._NOISE_STATIONARY` | `noisereduce` (lazy import) |
| VAD | on | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_VAD` | TEN-VAD gate |
| VAD min duration | 0.5s | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_MIN_DURATION_SEC` | Reject if stripped audio shorter |
| VAD min voice ratio | 0.25 | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_MIN_VOICE_RATIO` | Reject if voice fraction lower. Was 0.4 under silero — the false-positive gates split segments, which lowers the ratio |
| VAD speech-prob threshold | 0.5 | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_SPEECH_PROB_THRESHOLD` | TEN-VAD onset threshold (offset = −0.15); higher trims trailing/leading silence more. Was 0.6 under silero; TEN-VAD's measured operating point is 0.45–0.5, and the gates below now do that trimming |
| VAD speaker band | on | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_SPEAKER_BAND` | Keep only VAD frames in the clip's own pitch band |
| VAD max level drop | 20.0 dB | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_VAD_MAX_LEVEL_DROP_DB` | Drop VAD frames this far below the clip's own speech level; **empty string disables** |
| STOI gate | **off** | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_STOI` | SQUIM-OBJECTIVE intelligibility gate (after VAD, before RMS). Off by default: it rejected real speakers often enough that turns lost their speaker entirely — worse than a lower-confidence identification. Turn on in noisy rooms. |
| STOI model path | `/root/local/models/squimm_stoi.onnx` | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_STOI_MODEL_PATH` | ONNX estimator (~20 MB), downloaded from CDN on first use; gate skipped if unresolvable |
| STOI threshold | 0.70 | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_STOI_THRESHOLD` | Reject if mean STOI below this |
| STOI chunk | 5.0s | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_STOI_CHUNK_SEC` | Chunk length scored, then mean-aggregated |
| RMS normalize | on | `HAL_SPEAKER_PROC_ENABLE_RMS_NORMALIZE` / `..._RMS_TARGET` (0.1) | Fixed-loudness normalize |

### Debug tracing (temporary)

`speaker_recognizer.py` carries a self-contained diagnostic tracer, tagged `SPEAKER-DEBUG` throughout the file, for tuning recognition thresholds on real audio. **It is OFF by default (production-safe) — set `HAL_SPEAKER_DEBUG=true` to enable it during development**, and it is meant to be deleted entirely before a final deploy. `grep -n "SPEAKER-DEBUG"` finds every line belonging to it; no other module or config file is involved.

Each `recognize()` / `enroll()` call writes one directory:

```
<root>/recognize/<ts>_<class>_<confidence>/     class = enrolled name | stranger-<N> | unknown
<root>/recognize/<ts>_FAIL-<reason>/            no-voice | low-voice | low-stoi | too-short | server-error | …
<root>/enroll/<ts>_<norm>_<cohesion>/           cohesion = mean sim of kept samples to the centroid
<root>/enroll/<ts>_FAIL-<reason>/
```

holding `input.wav` (raw) plus `preprocessed.wav` (post VAD/STOI/RMS — the audio actually uploaded) / `sample_new_NN.wav`, the embeddings as `.npy`, `result.json`, and `profile.json` (latency + memory only — see below). A recognize records a `preprocessing` block (cleaned duration/RMS, the STOI score the clip passed with, and the threshold it cleared) so you can tell a "bad audio" miss from a "wrong speaker" miss; a clip killed by the gate instead files a `FAIL-<reason>` dir whose `preprocessing_reject` holds the structured reason and its measurements.

A gate reject also dumps **the audio the chain had produced when the gate said no** — `after_<stage>.wav`, named for the last stage that ran, with a `preprocessing_partial` block (that stage, the stage that rejected, duration/RMS/sample-rate). This is the point of it: a `FAIL-low-stoi` dir used to hold only the raw `input.wav`, so there was no way to hear the **TEN-VAD output** the STOI gate actually scored — the clip the rejection is about. Now that lands as `after_ten_vad.wav`. A VAD reject similarly files `after_resample.wav` (whatever ran before it). The enroll `FAIL-no-valid-samples` dir carries the same per sample: `sample_NN_input.wav` + `sample_NN_after_<stage>.wav`, with each sample's structured gate reason under `per_sample_errors`.

For a recognize the JSON carries the **full** decision breakdown — not just the top-3 `candidates` the API returns, but `speaker_summary` (votes + mean/max similarity for *every* enrolled speaker, including 0-vote losers) and `per_chunk_scores` (each chunk vs every speaker, plus which speaker that chunk voted for). The same matrix is saved as `chunk_scores.npy` (`[chunks × speakers]`, columns in `enrolled_speakers` order). Unknown speakers also record the stranger-cluster match score and which cluster was closest.

#### Latency, CPU + memory profile

Each trace dir also holds a **`profile.json`** — per-stage wall-clock, CPU and memory for the call, so a slow or memory-hungry turn can be attributed to a specific stage instead of the pipeline as a whole. It is kept in its own file rather than mixed into `result.json`, which is already dense with the recognition decision: timings and the decision breakdown are read for different reasons and each would bury the other. It rides on the existing tracer otherwise — same dir, same switch, no extra env var, on only when `HAL_SPEAKER_DEBUG=true`. A one-line summary is also logged (`SPEAKER-DEBUG profile [recognize]: total=… preprocess.stoi_gate=…ms/…%cpu/+…MB …`).

Stages form a **tree**: a stage opened inside another becomes its child, so containment is structural rather than a naming convention. Summing the top level gives the call total without double-counting, and each node's `self_ms` is its own time minus its children's — the parent's glue, not its children's work.

```
decode_input                base64/file read + WAV normalize to 16 kHz mono
preprocess                  the whole on-device chain
├─ decode_wav / encode_wav    WAV bytes ↔ float32 waveform, plus the base64 wrap
├─ processor_init             lazy build/start — first call loads TEN-VAD + ONNX STOI
├─ mono / resample / high_pass / noise_reduce / rms_normalize
├─ ten_vad                  ← the TEN-VAD stage (named `silero_vad` in traces predating the swap)
└─ stoi_gate                ← the STOI intelligibility gate
embed_api                   the embedding call
├─ request                  ← the HTTP round-trip itself
└─ decode                     response parse + L2 normalize
load_enrolled / match_vote / stranger_cluster / save_input_wav
```

**Memory.** RSS is sampled on a background thread (~20 ms) for the life of the call, and each stage reports the **peak inside its own window**. Endpoint-only sampling — read RSS at entry, read again at exit — is wrong for this pipeline: RSS moves only when the allocator asks the OS for pages or returns them, so a stage that allocates and frees inside its own window reports `0.00`, and a stage that runs while an earlier allocation is released reports a *negative* cost. Three numbers are therefore kept per stage:

| Field | Means |
|-------|-------|
| **`rss_peak_delta_mb`** | peak-during-stage minus RSS at entry — **the memory number to read**. Survives allocate-then-free. For a repeated stage it is the worst single occurrence, not a sum |
| `rss_end_delta_mb` | exit minus entry — what the stage *kept*. Legitimately negative when pages go back to the OS |
| `rss_peak_mb` / `rss_after_mb` | absolute high-water / final RSS during the stage |

**CPU.** `cpu_ms` is process CPU time, which is what catches the ONNX/torch intra-op thread pools — the work that makes `stoi_gate` expensive. `cpu_pct` is `cpu_ms/ms×100`, so **>100% means it used more than one core** and **~0% means it was blocked, not working** (`embed_api.request` should sit near zero — it is waiting on the network). `thread_cpu_ms` is the calling thread alone, so the gap between it and `cpu_ms` is roughly what the pools did. The top level adds `cpu_count` so >100% is interpretable.

Other notes worth knowing:

- **A stage that rejects is still measured.** A clip killed by VAD or STOI files a `FAIL-…` dir whose `profile.json` shows what those gates cost before they said no — a reject pays for the same inference as a pass.
- **Enroll aggregates.** It runs preprocess + embed once per sample, so shared stages sum their `ms`, with `calls` and `ms_max` alongside (both omitted when a stage ran exactly once).
- **RSS and CPU are process-wide.** A concurrent HAL thread allocating or burning CPU during a stage lands in that stage's numbers — no RSS-based method escapes this. Read a single stage's memory as an upper bound and prefer the shape across several calls.
- **`rss_source` changes what the numbers mean.** `psutil` / `statm` (on-device Linux) are current RSS — the accurate case. `rusage` — the macOS-without-psutil fallback — is a high-water mark that cannot fall, so `rss_end_delta_mb` overstates there.
- Memory is process RSS, not a Python-heap measure: the ONNX TEN-VAD and STOI sessions allocate outside the heap, where `tracemalloc` would see nothing.

| Parameter | Default | Env var | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Debug tracing | **off** | `HAL_SPEAKER_DEBUG` | Set `true` to enable (covers the trace **and** the profile). Read once at construction — restart HAL after changing |
| Output root | `speaker_logs/` next to `speaker_recognizer.py` | `HAL_SPEAKER_DEBUG_DIR` | Falls back to a temp dir if the source tree is read-only (device deploy) |
| Max entries | 1000 | `HAL_SPEAKER_DEBUG_MAX_ENTRIES` | Per-kind directory cap, oldest pruned; `0` = unbounded |

The default output dir is git-ignored — never commit trace output. The tracer swallows all of its own errors, so a failing trace can never break recognition.

## API Endpoints (HAL, port 5001)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/speaker/enroll` | Enroll voice from wav_paths + name |
| `POST` | `/speaker/record-enroll` | Record from the device mic (`arecord`, `duration_sec` 1–60, default 15) then enroll the capture |
| `POST` | `/speaker/recognize` | Recognize speaker from wav_path |
| `POST` | `/speaker/identity` | Link Telegram identity to existing profile |
| `POST` | `/speaker/remove` | Remove voice profile by name |
| `POST` | `/speaker/reset` | Remove all voice profiles |
| `GET`  | `/speaker/list` | List enrolled speakers |

### Error contract

`/speaker/enroll` distinguishes two failure classes:

| HTTP | When | Skill behavior |
|------|------|----------------|
| `400` | Audio-level reject (too short, silent, VAD found no speech, mean STOI below threshold → `low_intelligibility`, perception-service returned 4xx) | Ask user to re-record / speak more clearly |
| `503` | Embedding service unreachable (network, 5xx, malformed response) | Tell user to try again shortly — nothing on disk was modified |

`/speaker/recognize` never fails with 5xx for embedding outages — it returns `200` with `{name: "unknown", error: "<reason>"}` so the skill can gracefully degrade. Only input-level problems (missing WAV, bad base64) return `400`.

### Mic ownership during record-enroll

ALSA capture is exclusive — only one process may hold the mic. `/speaker/record-enroll` therefore stops the voice pipeline, records with `arecord`, and restarts the pipeline from its own `finally` block.

Any other path that starts the pipeline while that recording is in flight steals the capture device and **both** sides fail with `audio open error: Device or resource busy`: the enroll returns `500` and the voice loop dies on the same error. So every caller goes through `state.start_voice_service(reason)`, which refuses (and logs the reason) while `state._enrolling` is set. The single exception is record-enroll's own restore — it owns the stop and runs after the flag is cleared.

## Message Flow Examples

### Short utterance (blocked)
```
User says: "hey" (2 words, 0.9s audio)
→ HAL: skip recognition (< SPEAKER_MIN_AUDIO_S)
→ Message: "hey" (no prefix, no enroll instruction)
```

### Medium utterance (recognized but no enroll nudge)
```
User says: "turn on the lights please" (5 words, 3s audio)
→ HAL: recognize → unknown, _should_request_speaker_enroll(5 words, 3s) = false
→ Message: "Unknown Speaker: turn on the lights please"
→ Lamp: no "audio save at" in message → AppendEnrollNudge returns unchanged
→ Agent: responds normally, doesn't ask who user is
```

### Multi-turn combine (same voice cluster)
```
User turn 1: "nice to meet you today. Okay." (5 words)
→ HAL: recognize → unknown, voiceprint_hash=voice_5
→ WAV moved to /tmp/hal-unknown-voice/voice_5/incoming_A.wav
→ Message: "Unknown Speaker: [voice:voice_5] nice to meet you today. Okay. (audio saved at ..._A.wav. Note: audio is too short for single enrollment. If prior turns tagged the same voice_5, combine their saved paths with this one...)"
→ Agent: asks "Could you tell me your name?"

User turn 2: "I'm Alex." (2 words)
→ HAL: voiceprint_hash=voice_5 (same cluster, sim=0.75)
→ WAV moved to /tmp/hal-unknown-voice/voice_5/incoming_B.wav
→ Message: "Unknown Speaker: [voice:voice_5] I'm Alex. (audio saved at ..._B.wav...)"
→ Agent: scans prior turns for same [voice:voice_5] tag → finds path A
→ Agent: POST /speaker/enroll with wav_paths=[path_A, path_B], name="Alex"
→ Agent: "Nice to meet you, Alex!"
```

### Long utterance (full enroll flow)
```
User says: "Hi my name is Leo and I just got home from work..." (30 words, 8s audio)
→ HAL: recognize → unknown, _should_request_speaker_enroll(30 words, 8s) = true
→ Message: "Unknown Speaker: Hi my name is Leo... (audio save at /tmp/hal-unknown-voice/incoming_xxx.wav, auto enroll...)"
→ Lamp: AppendEnrollNudge → cooldown OK → append "[REQUIRED: Follow speaker-recognizer/SKILL.md...]"
→ Agent: detects "my name is Leo" → POST /speaker/enroll → "Nice to meet you, Leo!"
```

### Cooldown (blocked)
```
Same unknown speaker, 2 minutes later:
→ HAL: _should_request_speaker_enroll = true (long enough)
→ Message has "audio save at"
→ Lamp: AppendEnrollNudge → cooldown NOT elapsed (< 5 min) → skip instruction
→ Agent: sees "Unknown Speaker: ..." without SKILL instruction → responds normally
```

## Local CPU speaker model (Raspberry Pi)

Install the HAL `local-speaker` optional dependency (`sherpa-onnx==1.13.7`).
Download `wespeaker_en_voxceleb_resnet34.onnx` from the official
[Sherpa-ONNX speaker model release](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/speaker-recongition-models)
to persistent storage outside the repository. Model size is about 26.5 MB.
Run from the repository root with the HAL Python environment:

```sh
HAL_SPEAKER_MODEL=/absolute/path/wespeaker_en_voxceleb_resnet34.onnx \
  python -m hal.drivers.voice.speaker_recognizer.local_server
```

Set `SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5002/embed` in HAL's environment
and restart HAL. The explicit endpoint takes precedence over the cloud backend;
its API key defaults to empty. Loopback requests bypass cloud encryption.
The service binds only to 127.0.0.1 and needs no account or network during inference.
Run it as a persistent user service for reboot recovery, before HAL starts.

`GET /health` reports a model fingerprint. `/embed` accepts HAL-preprocessed mono
16 kHz WAV, with 0.5–120 seconds total per request and at most 8 recordings.
Enrollment embeds whole utterances; recognition uses overlapping 3-second windows
with 1-second hops. Vectors are normalized; the model fingerprint supports HAL's
existing migration of stored recordings when the model changes. Enrollment still
uses Settings → My Voice and the normal speaker API; do not edit profile files.
Recognition quality and the existing similarity threshold need checking with real
voices on the device. This identifies speakers; it does not replace transcription,
Piper speech output, or the conversational language model.

For the current Pi deployment, `lamp-speaker.service` runs the local endpoint at
login/startup. `SPEAKER_MATCH_COS=0.78` and `SPEAKER_DIVERSITY_COS=0.90` are initial
settings tested with repository speaker fixtures (same-speaker match and a
rejected different-speaker recording); they are not a measured household accuracy
guarantee. Validate again with enrolled users and the actual microphone.

The Pi's identity data is stored persistently under
`/home/pj/.local/share/lamp/identity/`: `users/` holds shared face/voice profiles,
`strangers/` holds face clusters, and `voice_strangers/` holds voice clusters.
HAL selects these through `HAL_USERS_DIR`, `HAL_STRANGERS_DIR`, and
`HAL_VOICE_STRANGERS_DIR` in `/home/pj/.config/lamp/hal.env`. These override the
temporary simulator paths. During migration, HAL was stopped and every copied
file was checked byte-for-byte; the original temporary folders were retained.
