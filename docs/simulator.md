# Simulator — the whole stack on a laptop

Run the **same binaries that ship to the board** on a developer machine: HAL with
virtual (or host) peripherals, os-server, the agent bridge, and the web UI.

There is no build tag and no second code path. Only the device-absolute paths
move, through one env var each (`system/lib/syspath` on the Go side, `HAL_*` on
the Python side). **Unset env = the board's behaviour, byte for byte** — which is
what makes the tested binary the shipped binary.

> **Source of truth:** this doc reflects the code. If they disagree, the code wins.

### What this is not

- **Not a physics simulator.** No mass, inertia, collision or torque. A pose that
  would jam on a real body succeeds here.
- **Not a claim that rendered geometry is correct.** The repo carries no
  calibrated joint hierarchy, pivots or CAD zero offsets.
- **Not `robots/sim`.** That is a separate minimal *body* (`motion` + `system`
  only) used to prove HAL mounts exactly what a `ROBOT.md` declares — see
  `robots/sim/ROBOT.md`. The laptop simulator boots the full **lamp** body.

# Setup

## Step 1 — Check prerequisites

| Need | Check with | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` CLI | `codex --version` | Install it yourself — nothing here installs it |
| codex logged in | `ls ~/.codex/auth.json` | `codex login` |
| `ffmpeg` | `ffmpeg -version` | Needed for music playback |
| `uv` | `uv --version` | Builds HAL's `hal/.venv`. `make sim` creates it on first run and re-syncs it whenever `hal/uv.lock` or `hal/pyproject.toml` moves ahead of it. If that first sync fails compiling `insightface`, see *insightface fails to build* below |
| `node` + `npm` | `node --version` | Needed for `make web-dev` only |

**Only `codex` works off-device.** Other runtimes have no `*-dev` target.

## Step 2 — Copy the config template

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/autonomous-os/config
cp scripts/dev/config.example.json /tmp/autonomous-os/config/config.json
chmod 600 /tmp/autonomous-os/config/config.json
```

## Step 3 — Fill in the config

```bash
$EDITOR /tmp/autonomous-os/config/config.json
```

### Required

| Key | Value | Missing → |
|---|---|---|
| `llm_api_key` | Your provider key | No TTS, no STT, no Gemini Live, no image description. The agent still answers text |
| `llm_base_url` | OpenAI-compatible base, e.g. `https://…/api/v1/ai/v1` | Same as above |

### Required only for the web UI (`make web-dev`)

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `admin_password_hash` | **bcrypt hash** (cost 10) of your login password — not the password |
| `session_secret` | Leave empty — os-server writes a random one on first login (`system/server/session/session.go`) |

### Optional

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `deepgram_api_key` | `""` | Set it to use Deepgram STT instead of `AutonomousSTT` |
| `realtime.enabled` | `true` | `false` → every turn goes to the main agent (slower, still works) |
| `wakeword` | `true` | `false` → always-listening, no wake phrase needed |
| `tts_voice` | `Rachel` | ElevenLabs voice |
| `stt_language` | `en` | STT language |
| `timezone` | `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` | IANA zone |

### Set automatically — do not edit

`device_type` · `agent_runtime` · `set_up_completed` — rewritten by
`os-dev-seed.sh` on every run.

### Leave empty

`device_id` · `mqtt_endpoint` · `mqtt_username` · `mqtt_password` ·
`fa_channel` · `fd_channel` — the backend uplink is off — see *The backend uplink is off*.

`telegram_bot_token` — if you copied a real device's config, **blank this**. One
bot token cannot have two pollers; the laptop would steal the device's messages.

## Step 4 — Run

Four terminals, in this order.

```bash
make sim SIM_MEDIA=host           # 1. HAL          :5001
make codex-dev CODEX_PORT=18892   # 2. agent bridge :18892
make os-dev    CODEX_PORT=18892   # 3. os-server    :5000
make web-dev                      # 4. web UI       :5173   (optional)
```

| # | Wait for this line before starting the next |
|---|---|
| 1 | `Simulation mode enabled for device 'lamp' (media=host)` |
| 2 | `[codex-gatewayd] listening on ws://127.0.0.1:18892/codex/ws/` |
| 3 | `Codex connected` |
| 4 | `VITE … ready` |

Rules:

- Start `make sim` first — os-server waits up to 120s on HAL's `/health`.
- `codex-dev` and `os-dev` must use the **same** `CODEX_PORT`. The default `18792`
  collides with an openclaw gateway if one is installed.
- macOS asks for **Microphone** and **Camera** on the first `SIM_MEDIA=host` run.
  Grant them, then re-run `make sim`.
- Drop `SIM_MEDIA=host` if you do not need voice — the stack still runs, silently.

## Step 5 — Verify

```bash
# 1. os-server is up
curl -s :5000/api/health/live

# 2. HAL is up and using host devices
curl -s :5001/simulator/state | jq   # expect media:"host", media_reasons:{}

# 3. The os-server → HAL path works (no LLM, ~50ms)
curl -s -X POST :5000/api/sensing/event -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"voice_command","message":"turn on the light"}'

# 4. The agent answers (~15s) — reply appears in terminal 3
curl -s -X POST :5000/api/sensing/event -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"voice_command","message":"introduce yourself"}'

# 5. Speak into the mic: say "hey lamp, what time is it"
grep '\[turn\] route=' /tmp/autonomous-sim/log/server.log | tail
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5001/simulator` — the 3D body
- `http://localhost:5173/monitor` — Flow Monitor (**`localhost`**, not `127.0.0.1`)

## Step 6 — Name your device (optional)

Wake words follow the agent name. Write:

```bash
echo '- **Name:** Lumi' > ~/.codex/workspace/IDENTITY.md
```

Picked up within 5 seconds, no restart. Now `hey lumi` works, alongside
`hey lamp` and `hey autonomous`.

---

# Reference

## What each `make` target does

| Target | Does | Does **not** |
|---|---|---|
| `make sim` | Boots HAL on the lamp body with virtual (or host) peripherals | — |
| `make hal-install` | `uv sync` — an **exact** reconcile of `hal/.venv`, dropping anything absent from `uv.lock`. `make sim` syncs by itself with `--inexact`, which keeps a hand-installed pytest | Does not install the `dev` extra (pyflakes); add `--extra dev` by hand |
| `make codex-dev` | **Only** runs `os-server codex-gatewayd`: a loopback WebSocket listener that spawns one `codex exec` per turn | No onboarding, no presync, **no skill sync** |
| `make os-dev` | Three things in sequence: `os-dev-build` (compile), `os-dev-seed` (prepare the state dir), then run the API — which also does all agent provisioning: `presync.sh`, seeding `AGENTS.md`/`SOUL.md`/`KNOWLEDGE.md`/`HEARTBEAT.md`, `downloadSkills()`, the skill watcher | — |
| `make web-dev` | Runs Vite in nginx's place (os-server serves no HTML) | — |

If the workspace is empty or the agent has no persona, look at **`os-dev`**, not
`codex-dev`.

### `os-dev-seed` vs `os-dev`

`os-dev-seed` is a prerequisite target of `os-dev`, not a separate step you
normally run. It touches only the state dir, never starts a process:

| It does | It does not |
|---|---|
| Refuses to continue if `config.json` is missing, printing the `cp` command | Create or overwrite `config.json` — that file is yours |
| Rewrites `device_type`, `agent_runtime`, `set_up_completed` in it | Touch any other key |
| Warns about empty `llm_api_key` / `admin_password_hash` | — |
| Seeds `config/bootstrap.json` (once) so skills can download | — |
| Backs up an existing `config.toml` to `config.toml.pre-os-dev` (once) | — |

`make os-dev-seed` runs it alone — useful to re-check the state dir without
booting the server.

## Config file locations

| | Path |
|---|---|
| Template (in the repo) | `scripts/dev/config.example.json` |
| Live config | `$OS_STATE_DIR/config/config.json` — default `/tmp/autonomous-os/config/config.json` |
| OTA metadata (auto-seeded) | `$OS_STATE_DIR/config/bootstrap.json` |
| Agent workspace | `$CODEX_HOME/workspace/` |

One config file serves **both** HAL and os-server, the same role
`/root/config/config.json` plays on a board: os-server resolves
`config/config.json` relative to its cwd (`make os-dev` cds into the state dir),
HAL reads `OS_CONFIG_PATH`.

The seed copies the template **once**. Later runs only rewrite `device_type`,
`agent_runtime` and `set_up_completed`; your edits survive.

## Which credential buys what

| You want | You need |
|---|---|
| The agent answers text | nothing — codex uses its own login |
| Skills install automatically | nothing — the CDN objects are public |
| The device speaks (TTS) | `llm_api_key` + `llm_base_url` |
| Voice input (STT) | `llm_api_key`, or `deepgram_api_key` |
| Sub-second voice (Gemini Live) | `llm_api_key` + `realtime.enabled` |
| The agent sees images | `llm_api_key` |

One key covers all of it: the realtime key falls back to `llm_api_key` and its
endpoint to `llm_base_url` + `/ws/gemini` (`hal/config.py`), so no separate Google
credential is involved.

## Media modes

`SIM_MEDIA` decides whether HAL opens the developer machine's peripherals.

| | `virtual` (default) | `host` |
|---|---|---|
| Camera | synthetic calibration scene, deterministic | the Mac's webcam (AVFoundation) |
| Mic / speaker | virtual device ids, never passed to `sounddevice` | real devices via PortAudio |
| **Voice pipeline** | **inert stub** | **the real one** — VAD, Silero, STT, realtime agent, wake word, `[turn] route=…` dispatch |
| Music | full pipeline into a null sink | audible |
| Permissions | none needed | macOS asks for Microphone + Camera |
| Suitable for | tests, CI, offline work | manual end-to-end checks |

The gate is `state.simulation_audio` (`hal/server.py`), not the raw media string.
That matters: `_sim_audio_probe()` runs first and flips the flag **back to
virtual** when a device is missing, busy or permission-denied, so a refused
microphone lands on the stub with a logged `[sim-media]` reason instead of a real
pipeline reading a dead device. `routes/voice.py` keys off the same flag, so the
boot path and `POST /voice/start` can never disagree.

Host mode never hard-fails. `GET /simulator/state` reports the outcome per
subsystem:

```json
{"media":"host","media_camera":"host","media_audio":"host","media_reasons":{}}
```

`media` is `"host"` only when both are; `media_reasons` carries the actionable
why for each downgrade. On macOS the permissions live under
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera / Microphone and must be granted to
the terminal app running HAL. Enumeration is not permission — the device list is
populated either way and only the first real read fails, which is why HAL probes
at boot rather than failing a turn later.

---

## Wake word and naming the agent

With `"wakeword": true` you must address the device. Prefixes are
`hello` `hey` `hi` `alo` `okay` `ok` `wake up`, combined with:

- the **agent name** from `$CODEX_HOME/workspace/IDENTITY.md`
- the **device type** (`lamp`)
- the permanent alias **`autonomous`**

To name the agent, write:

```markdown
- **Name:** Lumi
```

into `$CODEX_HOME/workspace/IDENTITY.md`. `WatchIdentity` polls that file every 5
seconds and pushes fresh wake words to HAL — **no restart needed**. HAL merges
them with the permanent set, so `hey lumi`, `hey lamp` and `hey autonomous` all
work. With no `IDENTITY.md`, the name falls back to `device_type`.

A wake phrase is accepted at the **start or end of any sentence** in the turn.
Mid-sentence is rejected — a device name inside a sentence is people talking
*about* the device.

After an authorized turn a follow-up window opens
(`HAL_WAKEWORD_FOLLOWUP_TIMEOUT_S`, code default **20s**; the lamp image sets 60)
and **resets after every authorized turn**, so a continuous conversation never
needs the name again. Set `"wakeword": false` for always-listening.

---

## The two web UIs

They are different things and easy to confuse.

### `http://127.0.0.1:5001/simulator` — the body

Served by HAL. Only when `HAL_SIMULATE=1` **and** the body is `lamp`; otherwise
404. An orbitable view of the lamp's rigged GLB — five joint nodes named exactly
as HAL names them (`base_yaw`, `base_pitch`, `elbow_pitch`, `wrist_pitch`,
`wrist_roll`) — driven by live joint values, plus recording playback and LED
controls that call the same `/servo/*` and `/led/*` endpoints a skill calls.

Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, double-click to reset. The LED ring reads
`/simulator/pixels` (the strip buffer itself), not `/led/color`, because the
latter reports an effect's static base colour and would render breathing, candle
and rainbow as one dead colour.

The rendered pose is a visual response to live joint values, **not** a claim that
it is physically correct.

### `http://localhost:5173/monitor` — the product UI

Flow Monitor, Settings, Logs — the same SPA that runs on a board.

os-server serves **no HTML**: on a device nginx serves `web/dist` and proxies
`/api` and `/hw` to `:5000`. `make web-dev` puts Vite in nginx's place, with
`LAMP_PROXY` naming the device the SPA talks to. A `.env` in `system/web/` still
wins (vite.config reads it before `process.env`), so pointing at a real Pi is
unchanged.

> **Vite binds `[::1]` only** — `127.0.0.1:5173` is refused and looks like the
> server never started. Use `localhost`.

Log in with the password whose bcrypt hash is in `admin_password_hash`.
Alternatively append `?llm_api_key=<the key in config.json>` — but note this
misses on the *first* load of a fresh tab (`api.ts` initialises its token from
`sessionStorage` at module load, and `AuthGate`'s effect runs before `App`'s
`useBearerFromQuery`), so navigate to `/monitor` a second time in the same tab.

There is no third way: an empty `admin_password_hash` is not an open door.
`VerifyAdminPassword` (`system/device/config_update.go`) refuses outright when
no hash is set, and it refuses off-device exactly as it does on a board — the
simulator runs the shipped binary, so it has no auth bypass to enable.

#### Setting your own password

A config copied from a device carries that device's hash. To log in with a
password of your own instead, generate a cost-10 hash and put it in
`admin_password_hash`:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" 'your-password' | tr -d ':\n'
```

`htpasswd` ships with macOS. It emits a `$2y$` prefix where Go's `bcrypt` writes
`$2a$`; both verify against the same algorithm and `CompareHashAndPassword`
accepts either, so paste the output as-is. The leading `""` is the username
field, which os-server does not use — `tr` strips it along with the newline.

---

## What is simulated

Boot on the lamp body mounts 12 routes and skips one:

```
mounted=['audio','bluetooth','camera','emotion','led','music','scene',
         'sensing','servo','speaker','system','voice']  skipped=['buddy']  failed_required=[]
```

### Runs exactly as on a board

- the whole route surface — still decided by `ROBOT.md`, not by the simulator
- safety gates — joint clamps, `motion.max_speed`, the LED brightness ceiling
- the declaration-driven mount plan
- emotion presets, scene, music, bluetooth, system routes
- `TrackerService`, volume, user/stranger stores

### Substituted

| Subsystem | Board | Simulator |
|---|---|---|
| Servo | `feetech` over a serial bus | `MockMotionService` — joints are floats in a dict; moves interpolate over their commanded `duration` and block until arrival; `aim`/`nudge` obey `SAFETY.md`'s `max_speed`; CSV recordings replay through the same 30 Hz stretch-and-resample timing, so an animation takes the same wall-clock time |
| LED | WS2812 over SPI | `_MemoryStrip` — a real pixel buffer in RAM, effects run for real, still funnelled through the same brightness clamp |
| Camera | `opencv`/V4L2 | `virtual` (synthetic scene) or `host` (the Mac's webcam) |
| Sensing | `SensingService` + face recognition | `VirtualSensingService` — keeps presence state and the route contract; no perception-service calls, no face identity |
| Board profile | reads the device tree | the inert `sim` profile |
| Music output | `aplay` (ALSA) or `paplay` (PulseAudio) | ffmpeg's AudioToolbox output device on macOS |
| Voice enroll capture | `arecord` over the ALSA alias | PortAudio (`sounddevice`) on the same input device the voice pipeline records with; the WAV carries its own rate and the recognizer resamples |
| GELF logging | ships to the log server | off |
| GPIO button / touchpad | real | skipped (`_board_id != "sim"` gate) |

`HAL_BOARD=sim` is refused without `HAL_SIMULATE=1` — HAL will not boot physical
drivers on a virtual board.

---

## Environment reference

### Go side — `system/lib/syspath`

Every accessor keeps its production default and is overridden by exactly one env
var. `make os-dev` and `make codex-dev` share one set so the bridge and its
client can never disagree.

| Env | Board default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CODEX_HOME` | `/root/.codex` | Root of every codex path, in the client *and* the gatewayd |
| `CODEX_PORT` | `18792` | Bridge listener + `WSURL` |
| `CODEX_WS_TOKEN` | `autonomous_codex_token` | Bearer token between os-server and the bridge |
| `OS_AGENT_HOME` | `/root` | Root a Telegram coding session resolves `~` against |
| `OS_AGENT_STATE_PATH` | `/root/config/agent_state.json` | Runtime-switch history |
| `OS_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG` | `/root/config/bootstrap.json` | Source of `metadata_url` — the skill-zip base |
| `OS_LOG_FILE` | `/var/log/os-server.log` | os-server's rotating log |
| `OS_BACKEND_UPLINK` | `on` | Backend ping + MQTT. `make os-dev` sets `off` |
| `OS_HAL_LOG_FILE` | `/var/log/hal/server.log` | Where the web UI reads HAL's log from |
| `OS_AGENT_BRIDGE_LOG` | `""` (use the journal) | File to read the bridge from when there is no systemd |
| `DEVICES_DIR` | `/opt/devices` | Root of `robots/<type>/` |

Only `"off"` disables `OS_BACKEND_UPLINK` — any other value, including a typo,
keeps it on, so a fleet upgrade can never silently take devices off their uplink.

### HAL side

HAL already read all of these; the `sim` target is what points them somewhere a
laptop can write. Their failures surface far from their cause — the TTS cache one
appeared as `POST /voice/speak 409` with the real `PermissionError` buried in a
background thread's traceback — which is why they are set as a block.

| Env | Board default | `make sim` |
|---|---|---|
| `OS_CONFIG_PATH` | `/root/config/config.json` | `$OS_STATE_DIR/config/config.json` — the file shared with os-server |
| `HAL_SNAPSHOT_DIR` | `/root/.<runtime>/media/hal-snapshots` | `$CODEX_HOME/media/hal-snapshots` — must sit under the agent's own home, or it cannot read the frame back and os-server cannot serve its thumbnail |
| `HAL_CODEX_WORKSPACE_DIR` | `/root/.codex/workspace` | `$CODEX_HOME/workspace` — the realtime agent's `memory.jsonl` derives from it |
| `HAL_LOG_DIR` | `/var/log/hal` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/log` |
| `HAL_SNAPSHOT_PERSIST_DIR` | `/var/lib/hal/snapshots` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/snapshots` |
| `HAL_TTS_CACHE_DIR` | `/var/lib/hal/tts_cache` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/tts_cache` |
| `HAL_CALIBRATION_DIR` | `/var/lib/hal/calibration/…` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/calibration/…` |
| `HAL_USER_BEARING_PATH` | `/var/lib/hal/user_bearing.json` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/user_bearing.json` |
| `HAL_FACE_HEIGHT_PATH` | `/var/lib/hal/face_height.json` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/face_height.json` |
| `HAL_USERS_DIR` / `HAL_STRANGERS_DIR` / `HAL_VOICE_STRANGERS_DIR` | `/root/local/…` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/…` |
| `HAL_BT_STATE_DIR` / `HAL_VOLUME_STATE_PATH` | `/var/lib/hal`, `…/.volume` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/…` |
| `HAL_DL_STALL_LOG` | `/root/local/dl_ws_stall.log` | `$SIM_STATE_DIR/dl_ws_stall.log` |
| `HAL_SIMULATE` / `HAL_BOARD` / `HAL_SIM_MEDIA` | unset | `1` / `sim` / `$(SIM_MEDIA)` |

Two device defaults are deliberately left alone: `/root/local/models` and
`/opt/piper` are read-only model paths. Absent on a laptop, the feature that
needs them simply stays off.

### Makefile knobs

| Knob | Default |
|---|---|
| `DEVICE_TYPE` | `lamp` |
| `SIM_MEDIA` | `virtual` |
| `SIM_STATE_DIR` | `/tmp/autonomous-sim` |
| `OS_STATE_DIR` | `/tmp/autonomous-os` |
| `OS_AGENT_RUNTIME` | `codex` |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `$HOME/.codex` |
| `CODEX_PORT` | `18792` |
| `CODEX_BIN` | first `codex` on `PATH` |
| `OS_BACKEND_UPLINK` | `off` |
| `HAL_PORT` | `5001` |
| `LAMP_PROXY` | `http://127.0.0.1:5000` |

Every path in the environment tables above is a knob too — each is its own `?=`
variable, so one can move without touching the rest:

```bash
make sim HAL_TTS_CACHE_DIR=/Volumes/sd/tts     # one path
make sim SIM_STATE_DIR=~/work/sim-a            # all of them
```

An exported shell variable wins over the default for the same reason. Two pairs
stay coupled through a variable rather than a repeated literal, so overriding one
half moves the other: `OS_HAL_LOG_FILE` derives from `HAL_LOG_DIR` (HAL writes,
os-server reads it for the web UI's HAL tab), and `codex-dev`'s `tee` target is
`OS_AGENT_BRIDGE_LOG` itself (bridge writes, os-server reads it for the Agent tab).

---

## The backend uplink is off

`make os-dev` sets `OS_BACKEND_UPLINK=off`, which stops two things: the 15s
status ping (`system/device/status_reporter.go`) and the MQTT command channel
(`system/server/mqtt.go`).

This is not a simulator preference — it is a safety interlock. **The backend
identifies a device by its `llm_api_key`, not by `device_id`**, so a laptop
holding a copy of a device's config is indistinguishable from that device.
Measured with both running:

- the ping overwrote the real device's `local_ip`, `mac`, `version` and `skills`
  every 15 seconds
- the MQTT client ids — derived from the `device_id` the backend hands back —
  collided, and the two clients evicted each other from the broker about once a
  second, indefinitely

Config edits cannot avoid this: blanking `device_id` gets the same id back, and
blanking `mqtt_endpoint` is undone by the ping response, which writes the broker
config to disk and triggers `restartMQTT`. Blocking the subscriber is enough for
the whole chain — both publisher clients connect lazily, and the chat stream only
publishes for runs a backend `chat.send` created.

Nothing a developer needs goes through the uplink: the web UI, Flow Monitor,
voice pipeline, agent, skills and Telegram (polled directly by the device) are
all local. What is lost is remote control: phone-app chat, remote OTA, remote
skill installs, and the Slack webhook proxy.

`make os-dev OS_BACKEND_UPLINK=on` re-enables it. Only do that when the laptop is
not carrying a live device's credentials.

## Logs

| Web UI tab | Off-device |
|---|---|
| HAL | ✅ `$SIM_STATE_DIR/log/server.log` |
| OS | ✅ `$OS_STATE_DIR/os-server.log` |
| Agent / Agent Service | ✅ `$OS_STATE_DIR/codex-gatewayd.log` — `make codex-dev` tees the bridge to a file (`2>&1`, because Go's `slog` writes to stderr) since a laptop has no journal |
| Bootstrap | ❌ the OTA worker has no off-device target |
| Claude Desktop Buddy | ❌ a separate Mac app that writes no log here |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `codex CLI not found on PATH` | The agent is not installed — see *Step 1* |
| `curl :5000` returns a binary plist or 403 | os-server is not running — macOS AirPlay Receiver answers on `*:5000`. Turn it off (System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff) or change `httpPort` |
| `listen failed: address already in use` | `CODEX_PORT` left at `18792`, which an openclaw gateway holds |
| `bad handshake (status 404)` | `codex-dev` and `os-dev` disagree on `CODEX_PORT` |
| `dial 127.0.0.1:5001: connection refused` | HAL is not up yet |
| `127.0.0.1:5173` refuses the connection | Vite binds `[::1]` — use `localhost:5173` |
| Speaking does nothing | Missing `SIM_MEDIA=host`, or macOS denied the microphone. Check `media_reasons` in `/simulator/state` |
| Voice enroll returns 503 `needs a real microphone` | `SIM_MEDIA=virtual` — enroll refuses to open the host mic in a mode that promises not to |
| Voice enroll returns 400 `vad_removed_all` | The clip held no speech. Read the phrases aloud, closer to the mic, for the full countdown |
| STT hears the wrong name | `flux-general-en` mis-hears proper nouns; "hi lamp" has come back as "hi lance", and a miss drops the whole turn silently. Wake terms are sent as STT boost terms, but say the name clearly |
| `POST /voice/speak 409` + `PermissionError: /var/lib/hal` | `HAL_TTS_CACHE_DIR` not set — an old `sim` target |
| "Sorry, I can't play that right now" | Music: macOS has no `aplay`/`paplay`. Needs `ffmpeg` on `PATH` for the AudioToolbox route |
| `POST /audio/volume` returns 503 | Expected — macOS has no ALSA mixer |
| Agent calls itself "Codex", no persona | `$CODEX_HOME/workspace` must hold `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `KNOWLEDGE.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`. These come from `os-dev`, not `codex-dev` |
| Empty workspace, no `seeded file` log | `set_up_completed` is not true, so the startup sequence never ran |
| `skill download skipped: no ota_metadata_url` | `config/bootstrap.json` missing |
| `uv sync` fails building `insightface`, `ld: library 'c++' not found` | See below |

### insightface fails to build

`insightface` compiles C++, and the interpreter `uv` picked decides which SDK
that compile targets. A Homebrew Python bakes the SDK path it was built against
into its own `sysconfig`, so on a machine whose macOS has moved on, the build
points `-isysroot` at an SDK that is no longer installed:

```
Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist:
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX13.sdk
ld: library 'c++' not found
```

Setting `SDKROOT` does not help — the stale flag comes from `sysconfig`, not the
environment. Build the venv against a `uv`-managed interpreter instead, which
carries no such baked-in path:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
cd hal && uv sync --inexact --python-preference only-managed -p 3.12
```

`make sim` reuses the resulting `hal/.venv`, so this is a one-time fix.

## What does not work off-device

| | Why |
|---|---|
| Backend uplink | Off by design — see *The backend uplink is off* |
| Bootstrap / OTA | `bootstrap-server` has no off-device target |
| Claude Desktop Buddy logs | Separate Mac app |
| Any runtime other than codex | No `*-dev` target; never exercised on a laptop |
| Real `SensingService` (face, motion perception) | Its module imports the Feetech driver, which pulls `lerobot`. `VirtualSensingService` stands in |
| Face recognition, speech emotion, speaker ID | Need the perception service / embedding endpoint |
| GPIO button, touchpad, mic button | No hardware; skipped at boot |
| SoC temperature | `temp_c: null`, so the thermal-throttle path is untestable |

## Why the board is unaffected

Every off-device behaviour sits behind an env var whose unset value is the
board's, or behind a platform check a board never satisfies:

| Change | Board |
|---|---|
| Voice-pipeline gate | `state.simulation_audio` is False when `HAL_SIMULATE` is unset — identical to the `_simulation` check it replaced |
| macOS music route | Guarded by `sys.platform == "darwin"` |
| `record-enroll` capture backend | `shutil.which("arecord")` finds it on the board, so the PortAudio fallback never runs |
| `BackendUplink()` | Defaults on; the var appears in no unit file, rootfs or image script |
| Every `syspath` accessor | Unset env returns the literal it replaced |
| Makefile, docs | Not shipped to the device |

Guarded by tests that assert the *board* contract, not the laptop one:
`system/lib/syspath/syspath_test.go` (`TestDeviceDefaults`, `TestAgentRuntimeHome`,
`TestBackendUplink`), `system/server/logs_source_test.go`
(`TestResolveLogSourceBoardDefaults`) and `runtimes/codex/paths_default_test.go`.

### Temporary Pi webcam and microphone

The local `launchcommand` may load `$OS_STATE_DIR/media.env`. Set `SIM_MEDIA=host`, `HAL_CAMERA_INDEX=0`, and `HAL_AUDIO_INPUT_ALSA=plughw:CARD=C1,DEV=0` for the temporary Opal C1. The Lamp definition already declares vision and audio; motors and LEDs remain simulated. `lamp-dev.sh` explicitly forwards media settings into tmux, including an optional `HAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE` override. On this Pi index 0 is HDMI output (speaker playback is unverified); recheck device indices after reconnecting hardware. Remove `media.env` and restart to restore virtual inputs. Host media provides capture; Claude login alone does not configure speech recognition or speech synthesis.

### Pi 5 with Camera Module 3 and simulated motors

Set `HAL_SIMULATE=1`, `HAL_SIM_MEDIA=host`, and `HAL_SIM_CAMERA_DRIVER=rpicam`
in the boot service environment (`~/.config/lamp/hal.env` on the local Pi).
The CSI camera uses the existing `rpicam-vid` backend; motors and LEDs remain
simulated, and host audio selection is unchanged. The default camera driver is
`host`; virtual media still uses a virtual camera regardless of this override.
HAL owns the sensor and shares frames through `/camera/stream`, snapshots, and
OS vision. View the camera at `http://<device-lan-ip>/monitor#camera`.
The enabled `lamp-stack.target` and user lingering start the stack without login;
the component service restarts on failure. Save the camera setting in the service
environment so it persists across reboots. Do not run a second camera owner.

On this Pi, nginx forwards the dashboard at port 80 to the boot-managed Vite
service on port 5173. `/api/` remains on os-server with authentication intact;
proxy buffering is disabled for live camera streams.

The Pi preview uses 1280×720 capture and stream width, `HAL_RPICAM_ACTIVE_FPS=40`, `HAL_CAMERA_STREAM_FPS=40`, and `HAL_CAMERA_STREAM_JPEG_QUALITY=85`. These are target rates; actual throughput depends on load. CSI capture returns to 5 fps without consumers. Other devices retain the default 15 fps active capture.

MJPEG pacing includes frame processing in its interval, so JPEG encoding no longer adds an extra delay to each frame.

Virtual sensing does not provide face recognition. Identity resolution treats that as no visible face and falls back to the recognized voice, without logging a missing-perception traceback.

HAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE accepts an integer index or an exact output name. On PipeWire desktops, install pipewire-alsa and set HAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE=pipewire and HAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT_ALSA=pipewire to follow the desktop speaker selection, including Bluetooth. Restart HAL after installing the bridge. Named output selection survives device index changes.

## Pi prototype output preview

The built-in `/simulator` follows `/servo/output` at up to 30 Hz, using the Pi motion service's joint angles directly without browser motion easing. The response identifies the driver, degree units, sample time, tracking state and whether positions are simulated or driver-reported. `physical_feedback_verified` is false: this endpoint does not independently verify hardware feedback. Failed motion reads freeze the last pose and show an unavailable notice after one second; the viewer never substitutes local motion. Camera and audio retain the existing effective host/virtual indicators.

The current simulated Lamp uses the mock motion driver; it does not send CubeMars CAN packets. The separate GL40 bench controller and design simulator are not integrated by this change. A calibrated joint-to-motor mapping and CAN backend remain necessary before these angles can drive the prototype.

The Pi motion style controls call `/servo/affect`, selecting neutral, curious, calm, happy, sad, excited or fearful. They modify existing tracking smoothing/speed, inherit the neutral calibration, and retain the downstream safety speed cap. They do not start tracking, resume held motors, add pose offsets or replace the existing emotion recording controls. GET returns profiles and current affect; POST accepts `name`, `intensity` (0–1, default 1), `transition_s` (0–10, default 0.5).

The optional Lamp display now renders a provisional 240×240 framebuffer on the Pi. Simulation explicitly disables panel hardware initialization. `/display/frame.png` is a lossless encoding of the same rendered frame passed to the display driver, not a second browser renderer; the viewer polls up to 15 Hz and hides failed frames. `/display/snapshot` retains JPEG compatibility. This preserves source RGB pixels, not physical brightness/color, panel pixel-format conversion or every animation frame over the network. Final panel model/resolution remains unconfirmed.
