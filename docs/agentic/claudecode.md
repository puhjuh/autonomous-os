# Claude Code Agent Backend

How `os-server` drives **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI agent) as the device's
swappable agentic runtime, alongside OpenClaw, Hermes, PicoClaw, Codex, and
OpenCode. Generic
mechanics (switch flow, install-vs-presync, migration, checklist) live in
[`adding-agent-runtime.md`](adding-agent-runtime.md); this file is the
claudecode-specific protocol, layout, and quirks.

> **Status:** full parity with the checklist — embedded install + presync,
> WebSocket bridge transport, persona/memory Go migration adapter (lossless with
> the OpenClaw layout), skills (CDN restore + watcher, native `.claude/skills`),
> identity watch/rename, real MCP (`.mcp.json`), factory reset, Telegram +
> Discord device-owned (os-server getUpdates loop `telegram_poll.go` /
> discordgo session `discord.go` — the native channel plugins are deliberately
> not used),
> device-owned **Slack inbound** (HTTP mode, `domain.SlackBridge`),
> and the **claude.ai OAuth login** flow (§7b) as an alternative to the
> config.json API key. Known caveats are flagged ⚠️ in §11.

Code: `runtimes/claudecode/`.

## 1. Selection + install

`config.agent_runtime: "claudecode"` (or ROBOT.md `gateway.default`) resolves the
backend in `system/agent/factory.go`. Switching in/out goes through the generic
`switch-runtime` flow — nothing claudecode-specific in the switcher.

**`install.sh`** (embedded, runs once on first switch / failed verify):

1. prerequisites: `jq curl`;
2. Claude Code CLI via the official native installer
   (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` → `~/.local/bin/claude`,
   standalone binary, linux arm64/amd64, no Node.js), symlinked to
   `/usr/local/bin/claude`;

   > **Field updates** don't re-run this install path from scratch: publish with
   > `make upload-claudecode <bare-semver>` + `make promote-claudecode`, and the
   > bootstrap worker runs `software-update claudecode` (re-runs the installer
   > pinned to that version, re-points the symlink, restarts `claudecode.service`)
   > on devices whose `agent_runtime` is `claudecode`. No rollback backup exists —
   > the installer keeps `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>`, so downgrading
   > means publishing the older version. See `docs/bootstrap-ota.md` §5.
3. **no bun, no channel plugins** — telegram + discord are device-owned
   (os-server runs the receive loops itself, §7), so the plugin marketplace
   step is gone entirely;
4. runs the presync hook once (bridge + env + channel sync);
5. writes + starts **`claudecode.service`** (unit name == runtime name — no
   service declaration file). The unit runs `os-server claudecode-gatewayd`
   (with `EnvironmentFile=-/root/.claudecode/.env`). The unit body is duplicated
   in `gateway_unit.go` (`EnsureOnboarding` self-heal) — **keep the two in
   sync**;
6. verify hook `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/claudecode/verify` =
   `command -v claude` + an executable `/usr/local/bin/os-server` (the gatewayd
   ships inside it; presync heals everything else).

**`presync.sh`** (embedded; materialized to
`/usr/local/bin/runtime-claudecode-presync` on every switch, run by
switch-runtime before start, by install.sh once, and by `EnsureOnboarding` on
**every os-server boot / config change** — the hermes pattern, so a device that
boots straight into claudecode or edits `llm_*` while active self-heals
without a switch):

- the bridge itself is **no longer materialized here** — it ships inside the
  os-server binary as the `claudecode-gatewayd` subcommand, so a plain
  os-server OTA updates it;
- **§1 SEEDS** — `~/.claude.json` gets `hasCompletedOnboarding` +
  `bypassPermissionsModeAccepted` (no TTY to answer interactive prompts);
  `workspace/.claude/settings.json` gets `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true`
  (trust `.mcp.json` entries written by os-server);
- **§2 ENV** — `/root/.claudecode/.env`, in one of two **auth modes** (§7b):
    - *subscription* (`claude_code_oauth_token` set in config.json, or
      `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on disk): inject `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and
      **omit every `ANTHROPIC_*` var** — API-key vars outrank OAuth in Claude
      Code's credential precedence, so leaving them set would silently keep the
      device on the API-key path;
    - *api-key* (default): `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` ← `llm_base_url` **with a
      trailing `/v1` stripped** (llm_base_url is OpenAI-convention and ends in
      `/v1`; Claude appends `/v1/messages` itself, so an unstripped base hits
      `/v1/v1/messages` → 404), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` ← `llm_api_key`
      (**x-api-key only** — campaign-api 401s the `Authorization: Bearer` form,
      and claude prefers `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when
      both are set, so the bearer var must stay unset), `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` /
      `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` ← `llm_model` (default `Auto-AI`).

  Both modes add `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1`. `CLAUDECODE_CHANNELS` is no
  longer written (no channel plugins run — §7);
- **§3 CHANNELS** — nothing to configure anymore: presync just removes stale
  `~/.claude/channels` state from older versions (see §7).

## 2. Wire constants (`constants.go`)

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WSURL` | `ws://127.0.0.1:18791/claude/ws/` | bridge WebSocket endpoint |
| `Token` | `autonomous_claudecode_token` | bearer token on connect; the gatewayd defaults to the same constant (compiled into os-server) — the two MUST match |
| `Conversation` | `device-main` | label only; Claude owns the real session ids |

## 3. The bridge (`os-server claudecode-gatewayd`)

Claude Code has no server mode, so the systemd unit runs a small Go gatewayd
(`runtimes/claudecode/gatewayd/`, structurally mirroring the codex gatewayd —
no python3/websockets dependency) that:

- holds **one persistent headless Claude process**:
  `claude --print --verbose --input-format stream-json --output-format
  stream-json --dangerously-skip-permissions`, cwd = the workspace, env from
  `.env` plus asserted `HOME` and `IS_SANDBOX=1` (the device runs as root, and
  claude refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` under uid 0 without the
  containerized-root escape hatch); `--resume <session_id>` on respawn
  (session continuity across bridge restarts, state in `session.json`). The
  gatewayd still supports a `--channels <CLAUDECODE_CHANNELS>` passthrough,
  but presync no longer sets the var (channels are device-owned, §7);
- serves the WebSocket (gorilla/websocket), bearer-token gated (close code
  `4401` on a bad token); a single client at a time — a new connection replaces
  the old one;
- forwards Claude's stdout stream-json events **verbatim** to the connected
  client, converts `message.send` frames into stream-json `user` messages on
  stdin (data-URL image attachments → base64 `image` content blocks), answers
  `ping` with `pong`;
- restarts the child on exit (5 s backoff); when a turn was in flight it emits
  `bridge.error` so os-server closes the run instead of waiting out the busy
  TTL; `session.new` restarts the child **without** `--resume`;
- queues `message.send` frames that arrive while the child is down and flushes
  them on respawn.

### Security boundary: root, unsandboxed Claude execution

Both the persistent gatewayd child and the Telegram coding hand-off invoke Claude
with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as uid 0. `IS_SANDBOX=1` only satisfies the
Claude CLI's root-mode check; it does **not** sandbox the process. An accepted
coding request can therefore run tools with root-equivalent access to the device:
it may read device and agent credentials, change the root filesystem or services,
call local hardware APIs, and make network requests.

The Telegram `telegram_user_id` allowlist, the gateway WebSocket bearer token, and
the loopback-only service boundary are the authorization controls for this power.
Treat adding an allowlisted ID, exposing the bridge, or passing untrusted content
into the coding flow as granting root-level device control. Do not use this runtime
where that authority is unacceptable.

Paths, port and token are overridable via `CLAUDECODE_*` env vars
(`CLAUDECODE_WS_TOKEN`, `CLAUDECODE_PORT`, `CLAUDECODE_HOME`,
`CLAUDECODE_WORKSPACE`, `CLAUDECODE_ENV_FILE`, `CLAUDECODE_SESSION_FILE`,
`CLAUDECODE_BIN`, `CLAUDECODE_RESTART_BACKOFF_S`); the defaults match the
device layout above, so existing `/root/.claudecode` deployments run unchanged.

## 4. Sending a turn (`chat.go`)

Identical shape to picoclaw: `sendChat` marks busy + stashes the pending runID
**before** writing the frame, emits `chat_input`/`chat_send` flow events, and
returns as soon as the frame is written — the reply arrives on the read loop.
Outbound frame:

```json
{"type":"message.send","id":"chat-42","payload":{
  "content":"...","attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}]}}
```

Claude serializes queued inputs itself, so one turn is in flight at a time and
the single pending/current runID correlation holds.

`sendChat` also reproduces OpenClaw's `emotion-acknowledge` hook **natively in
Go** (`emotion_ack.go`, mirroring codex/hermes/picoclaw): each user-visible turn
fires `{emotion:"thinking"}` to HAL — same skip prefixes, same intensity, same
capability gate (`skills.SupportedHooks`) as the TS handler. The companion
`turn-gate` hook is intentionally not mirrored (sendChat already marks the turn
busy). ⚠️ Keep it in lockstep with
`runtimes/openclaw/hooks/emotion-acknowledge/handler.ts`.

## 5. Inbound events → `domain.WSEvent` (`translator.go`)

Claude stream-json events are translated into the same frames the OpenClaw
handler consumes:

| Claude event | Emitted |
|---|---|
| `system` (subtype `init`) | — (captures `session_id`) |
| `assistant` — `text` block | — (stashed as fallback final text) |
| `assistant` — `tool_use` block | `lifecycle.start` (once) + `tool.start` |
| `user` — `tool_result` block | `tool.end` (result text, matched by `tool_use_id`) |
| `result` subtype `success` | assistant delta (whole reply, N=1) + `chat.final` + `lifecycle.end` (+ per-turn `usage`) — the delta is what the shared consumer accumulates and flushes to TTS/`tts_send` at `lifecycle.end` |
| `result` subtype `error*` / `is_error` | `lifecycle.error` |
| `bridge.error` | `lifecycle.error` |
| `stream_event` / `pong` / `bridge.status` | ignored |

Turn-lifecycle gotchas:

- **The final text is `result.result`**, not the assistant text blocks —
  intermediate assistant text (between tool calls) is never rendered, only
  stashed as a defensive fallback.
- `usage` is **per-turn** (Anthropic API shape: `input_tokens`,
  `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`) —
  unlike picoclaw's cumulative `context_usage`.
- **Externally-initiated turns surface on the same stdout**: if anything ever
  runs inside the Claude session without a pending runID (e.g. a channel
  plugin, were one enabled), `ensureTurnStarted` allocates a fresh runID so
  the turn still shows up in the Flow Monitor. With all channels device-owned
  (§7) this is a defensive path only — telegram/discord/slack turns inject as
  regular `sendChat` turns with a pending runID.

## 6. Session

Claude owns the session: the id is captured from any event carrying
`session_id` and persisted by the bridge (`session.json`) for `--resume`.
`NewSession` sends `{"type":"session.new"}` (fresh session, no resume).
`ShouldRotateSession` rotates on **turn count (80) or a 150k-token spike**
(`rotation.go`): Claude Code's auto-compaction bounds the context *size* but
not persona fidelity — after enough compaction cycles the one-line
IDENTITY.md name drifts out of the compacted context (device-observed
2026-07-08: the agent invented a name), and `CLAUDE.md` @imports are only
re-read at session start, so periodic rotation is the re-anchor. Long-term
memory (MEMORY.md/KNOWLEDGE.md) survives via the imports; only verbatim
in-session conversation is lost. `CompactSession` returns
`domain.ErrNotSupportedByRuntime` (no external compact RPC).

## 7. Channels — all device-owned (telegram, discord, slack)

`SupportedChannels() = [telegram, slack, discord]`. All three receive loops
run inside os-server, mirroring `runtimes/codex` 1:1. Claude Code's native
telegram/discord channel plugins are **deliberately not used**: they proved
undebuggable in the field (bun children with no journal logs, silent
allowlist drops, silent death on bridge-restart races), and they would compete
with the device-owned loops for the same bot (Telegram 409s concurrent
pollers; Discord would double-reply). presync removes stale
`~/.claude/channels` state and install.sh no longer installs bun or any
plugin.

- **Telegram** (`telegram_poll.go`): one goroutine started from `StartWS`
  long-polls `getUpdates` and injects each accepted DM (private chat, sender ==
  `telegram_user_id`) as a regular chat turn with flow source `telegram`; the
  run is tracked in `telegramRuns` and **marked silent** (no TTS), a typing
  keeper fires `sendChatAction` while the turn runs, and `emitFinal` DMs the
  reply back (`[HW:/...]` markers stripped via `stripForChannel`). Offset
  persists in `/root/.claudecode/telegram_offset.json`. Creds are read fresh
  from config.json every poll iteration — token/user changes need no restart.
- **Discord** (`discord.go`): Discord has no long-poll receive API, so
  os-server owns a **discordgo gateway session** (DM + guild-message +
  message-content intents), started from `StartWS`. Accepted = not a bot,
  sender == `discord_user_id` (empty allowlist = closed), and either a DM or a
  message in `discord_guild_id` that **@mentions the bot** (mention stripped
  from the turn text). Accepted messages inject as turns with flow source
  `discord` (tracked in `discordRuns`, silent, native typing keeper);
  `emitFinal` posts the reply back **chunked at Discord's 2000-char limit**.
  Token is read fresh on every (re)connect attempt; while a session is open,
  discordgo handles gateway reconnects itself.
- `AddChannel`/`RefreshChannelConfig` are honest no-op successes for all three
  channels: the device-owned loops read creds fresh from config.json on each
  use, so persisting the creds is all that is needed (no presync, no bridge
  restart). Discord nuance: a token saved the first time is picked up within
  ~30 s, but rotating it while a session is open takes effect on the next
  session cycle. whatsapp → `domain.ErrChannelNotSupported`.
- **Slack is DEVICE-OWNED** (`slack.go` + `slack_sender.go`, a mirror of
  `runtimes/codex/slack.go`): Claude Code has no slack channel plugin ("Claude
  in Slack" is a separate cloud feature that spawns web sessions from `@Claude`
  mentions, not a device channel). Instead the public bff-campaign-service
  proxy receives Slack Events API deliveries and fans them out over MQTT to the
  device's `slack_event` handler
  (`server/device/delivery/mqtt/slack_event_handler.go`), which dedups by
  event_id and type-asserts the active gateway to `domain.SlackBridge` —
  implemented by `ClaudeCodeService`, so events route here only while
  claudecode is active. An accepted message (allowlist gate `slack_user_id`;
  bot/subtype/empty-user events dropped) waits for the agent to go idle
  (500 ms poll, 2 min cap) and is injected as a regular turn with flow source
  `slack`; the run is tracked in `slackRuns` and **marked silent** (no TTS),
  and an `eyes` ack reaction is added to the user's message. The final answer
  (`result` event → `emitFinal`, `translator.go`) is posted back to the
  originating channel/thread via `chat.postMessage` (`slack_bot_token`),
  `[HW:/...]` markers + audio tags stripped (`stripForChannel`, `hal.go`); the
  ack reaction is cleared on reply or error. **No progressive streaming**
  (`StreamSlackDelta` is a no-op — the answer arrives whole). Replies thread
  under the existing thread, else under the user's message.
- Outbound `Broadcast`/`SendToUser` (proactive nudges) go straight to the
  Telegram Bot API (`telegram_sender.go`); a `SlackSender` posts proactive
  messages to the configured `slack_user_id` channel when both slack creds are
  set. The shared target store (`/root/.lumi/telegram_targets.json`) is
  populated by the receive loop (`upsertTelegramTarget`) on every accepted DM;
  `GetTelegramTargets` falls back to the configured owner id while the store
  is still empty (`telegram.go`).

## 7b. Auth — claude.ai OAuth login (alternative to the API key)

The device can authenticate with the **user's own Claude subscription** instead
of `llm_api_key`. The flow (`runtimes/claudecode/login.go`, the
`domain.ClaudeLoginPairer` optional interface) mirrors the WhatsApp pairing
flow — streaming `PairingEvent`s — with one extra leg: the OAuth code travels
back into the flow.

1. `{"cmd":"claudecode_login"}` on fa_channel starts the flow: os-server runs
   `claude setup-token` under a pty (`script -qec` — the CLI refuses to run
   without a TTY) and scans its output.
2. `{"status":"pairing_url","login_url":"https://claude.ai/oauth/…"}` is
   streamed on fd_channel; the user opens the URL, authorizes, and copies the
   code.
3. `{"cmd":"claudecode_login_code","code":"…"}` feeds the code to the waiting
   CLI (written to the pty with a raw-mode `\r`).
4. On success the long-lived token (`sk-ant-oat01-…`) is persisted to
   config.json (`claude_code_oauth_token`), `EnsureOnboarding` re-runs presync
   (subscription-mode `.env` — see §1), and the bridge restarts into
   subscription auth. Fallback: if the token line was not captured but the CLI
   saved `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, that also counts as success — presync
   accepts either signal.

Non-claudecode runtimes answer `claudecode_login` with a one-shot failure
("claude login not supported on … backend"). MQTT contract details:
`docs/mqtt.md` §`claudecode_login`. ⚠️ Credential precedence is the trap here:
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` **outrank** the OAuth token, which
is why subscription-mode presync omits them entirely.

## 7c. Telegram remote coding-sessions (`telegram_coding.go`, `coding_sessions.go`)

Separate from the device-main persona turn: a Telegram chat can **attach to a
folder's interactive `claude` session and continue coding it from the phone**.
Usecase — code on the device terminal at home, walk out, keep going over
Telegram, across multiple folders each with its own session.

- **Discovery** (`coding_sessions.go`): claude stores each session as a JSONL
  transcript under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl` (root ⇒
  `/root/.claude/projects`). `allCodingSessions` walks that tree; each session's
  **real cwd is read from the transcript content** (a `cwd` field on its
  records), NOT decoded from the directory name — the `/`→`-` encoding is lossy
  for folders containing `-`. The listing shows the **3 most recent user
  prompts** (most-recent first) as the description — synthetic
  `<environment_context>`/`<system-reminder>` blocks the CLI injects as "user"
  messages are skipped (`isInjectedContext`). Sessions are **cwd-scoped**:
  `claude --resume <uuid>` only finds a session when run from its folder
  (device-proven: resuming from the wrong cwd returns `No conversation found`).
- **Commands** (intercepted in `handleTelegramUpdate` before the device-main
  injection): `/resume` (mirrors the claude CLI — no arg lists folders, `/resume
  <n>` picks by number, `/resume <folder>` picks the folder's newest) · aliases
  `/sessions` (list) + `/use <n|folder>` (pick) · `/sessions <folder>` (every
  session in one folder) · `/new <folder>` (fresh session, folder created if
  missing) · `/here` (current selection) · `/device` (back to the device-main
  persona) · `/help`. A chat with no selection and no command falls through to
  device-main unchanged.
- **Hand-off model, NOT co-editing.** Each accepted turn spawns a fresh `claude
  --print --output-format json [--resume <uuid>] --dangerously-skip-permissions`
  with `cmd.Dir` = the session folder and the prompt on stdin; the reply's
  `result`/`session_id` are parsed back (`parseClaudeJSONResult`) and the reply
  DMed (chunked at Telegram's 4000-char limit). The exec env = process env + the
  presync `.env` pairs (`ANTHROPIC_*`) + `IS_SANDBOX=1` + `HOME=/root` (root
  needs `IS_SANDBOX` for `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, same as the gatewayd
  child). A `/new` session's real uuid is captured from its first turn.
- **Guards.** A **per-folder mutex** serializes turns so two never append to one
  transcript. A **`/proc` scan** (`procHoldsFolder`) refuses a turn while an
  interactive `claude` TUI still holds the folder as its cwd — two writers would
  corrupt the transcript, so the model is hand-off (close the terminal session
  first). Only the allowlisted `telegram_user_id` reaches any of this (the same
  gate as ordinary Telegram turns); remote coding runs
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so the allowlist is the security boundary.
- **State.** Per-chat selection persists to
  `/root/.claudecode/telegram_coding.json` (survives restart — the chat stays in
  its session). This runs in os-server directly (its own `claude` subprocess per
  turn), independent of the persistent gatewayd child, so coding turns and the
  device-main persona never collide.
- **Terminal side — the `claude-sessions` picker (`cmd/os-server/cc.go`).**
  Claude's interactive `/resume` picker **excludes headless (`--print`)
  sessions by design** (filtered on how the session was created), so
  Telegram-created sessions never appear in it — but `claude --resume <id>`
  opens ANY session by id (device-proven). The device therefore ships its own
  picker: `claude-sessions` (a thin `/usr/local/bin/claude-sessions` wrapper
  installed by presync §5, sudo-reexecs into `os-server claude-sessions`)
  lists every session for the **current folder** (`-a` for all folders,
  `--json` for scripts) via the same `allCodingSessions` discovery (one source
  of truth, exposed as `claudecode.ListCodingSessions`), then execs
  `claude --resume <id>` in the session's folder with the presync `.env` +
  `IS_SANDBOX=1` + `HOME=/root` merged in. Telegram's `/resume <n>`·`/here`
  replies include the matching `claude --resume <id>` / `claude-sessions`
  hint. Codex needs no equivalent — `codex resume`'s own picker is global and
  already lists Telegram-created threads.

## 8. Workspace, persona, skills, MCP

- **`CLAUDE.md`** is Claude Code's auto-loaded memory file; onboarding owns an
  OS-managed block (marker-delimited, owner notes preserved below) holding the
  persona **@imports** (`@SOUL.md @IDENTITY.md @USER.md @MEMORY.md
  @KNOWLEDGE.md` — CLAUDE.md is the only file Claude loads by name) and the
  prompt discipline (skills whitelist rule, connectors rule, memory rules, user
  priority), adapted from picoclaw's AGENTS.md block.
- **Skills are USER-scoped** (`/root/.claude/skills/`, `claudecodeSkillsDir`), not
  project-scoped. Claude Code resolves *project* skills as `<cwd>/.claude/skills`,
  so a workspace-only install is invisible to any session whose cwd is not the
  workspace — notably the **coding sessions** the device spawns in `/root`,
  `/root/myapp`, … (`coding_sessions.go`). Field symptom: a coding session
  reported Gmail/Calendar "not connected" and wrote its own `send_email.py`,
  while the device chat (workspace cwd) answered correctly from the same tokens.
  User-level skills load in every session regardless of cwd.
  `migrateSkillsToUserScope()` lifts skills left in the workspace by an older
  os-server and deletes the legacy dir (leaving it would double-register every
  skill). A factory reset wipes `/root/.claude/skills` explicitly.
- **User-level memory** (`/root/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `userClaudeMDBlock`): the
  workspace `CLAUDE.md` only reaches the device-chat session, so the device-wide
  connector rules are also injected here — Claude Code loads this file in every
  session, in any folder. Kept small on purpose: persona/memory rules stay
  workspace-scoped; only facts that must survive a `cd` live here.
- **Connectors rule (in both CLAUDE.md blocks).** Claude Code auto-discovers the
  `connectors` skill, but discovery alone is not enough:
  the model would not select it, and answered "no Gmail/Calendar connected" from
  `.mcp.json` while a valid `google_calendar` token sat on disk. The block
  therefore states the connector facts outright — credentials live in
  `/root/.openclaw/workspace/configs/<code>_access_tokens.json`, token
  connectors (Gmail/Calendar/Drive) have **no** MCP server so `.mcp.json` is not
  the connector list, and a question *about* a linked service is not "ordinary
  chat" exempt from skills. It also disambiguates "my events" (Google Calendar)
  from `/root/local/flow_events_*.jsonl` (device events).
- **SOUL block**: same `soul_ref` device-soul injection as openclaw/picoclaw.
- **Persona migration** (`migrate_persona/runtime_claudecode.go`): the layout is
  deliberately **identical to OpenClaw's** (IDENTITY.md its own slot, MEMORY.md
  at the workspace root, KNOWLEDGE.md + daily `memory/*.md`), so every slot maps
  1:1 and round-trips with slot-bearing runtimes are structurally lossless.
  `CLAUDE.md` itself is runtime-specific and never carried.
- **No HEARTBEAT.md** — Claude Code has no heartbeat loop that would read it; a
  conscious skip, not an oversight.
- **Skills** live in `/root/.claude/skills/` (native, auto-discovered).
  On every onboarding, the capability gate is applied and the complete supported
  catalog is reconciled from the CDN, repairing stale local files even when the
watcher starts after an OTA publish. `skill_watcher.go` then polls OTA metadata
every five minutes for later publishes. A real content change restarts the
bridge and then notifies the agent through `SendSystemChatMessage` to re-read it.
A failed ZIP download or extract leaves the version pending for the next poll.
- **MCP is real** (`mcp.go`): `WriteMCPEntry`/`RemoveMCPEntry` upsert
  `workspace/.mcp.json` `mcpServers` (canonical `{command,args,env}` /
  `{type,url,headers}` entries pass through verbatim) + bridge restart;
  `MCPReconcile` clones connectors on a runtime switch via
  `claudecode.ReadMCPEntries`.
- **LLM config migration** (`migrate_config/runtime_claudecode.go`): reads/writes
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in `/root/.claudecode/.env`.

## 9. What is real vs no-op (`stubs.go`)

Real (beyond the transport): `SetupAgent`/`EnsureOnboarding` (presync run +
workspace blocks + skills restore + unit self-heal, hash-diff restart),
`ResetAgent`, `RestartAgent`, `WatchIdentity`/`UpdateIdentityName`,
`StartSkillWatcher`, `WriteMCPEntry`/`RemoveMCPEntry`, `NewSession`,
`GetConfigJSON` (workspace settings.json — never the secret-bearing `.env`),
`Version` (`claude --version` probe), and the `domain.ClaudeLoginPairer`
surface (`StartClaudeLogin`/`SubmitClaudeLoginCode` — §7b).

No-op with reasons: `HasWhatsappSession`/`PairWhatsapp` (Baileys is
OpenClaw-only), `FetchChatHistory` (`TODO(claudecode-history)` — session JSONL
has no stable read API), `StartModelSync`/`StartPrimaryModelWatch` (fixed
model via env). `RefreshModelsConfig`/`UpdatePrimaryModel` (model =
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, presync-owned) and `CompactSession` (auto-compaction, §6)
return `domain.ErrNotSupportedByRuntime` so the caller falls back to
`EnsureOnboarding`, whose presync applies model changes;
`ShouldRotateSession=false`.

## 10. Factory reset (`reset.go`)

Stop + verify `claudecode.service`, disable it, then wipe **user data + creds**:
`workspace/`, `.env`, `session.json`, `~/.claude/projects`,
`~/.claude/channels`, `~/.claude/todos`, `~/.claude/history.jsonl`, and
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` (the claude.ai login — its config.json half,
`claude_code_oauth_token`, is wiped with the config). **Kept** (installed
software): the claude CLI, `~/.claude.json` (the bridge itself ships inside
the os-server binary). Everything wiped has a restore path that runs after
the reset (presync/EnsureOnboarding rebuild the env from the re-entered
config.json; the device-owned channel loops need nothing beyond config;
`ensureSkills` re-downloads skills; the login flow re-runs for subscription
auth).

## 11. ⚠️ Verify on device

- **`claude setup-token` output format**: the login scanner matches the OAuth
  URL, the `sk-ant-oat01-…` token, and textual success markers — verify against
  the CLI build on the device (the flow degrades to
  `failure (last output: …)` with the CLI's final line when parsing misses).
  The pty writes use `\r` for Enter; confirm the code-paste prompt accepts it.
- **campaign-api compatibility**: Claude Code drives the full Anthropic
  Messages API (system prompts, tool_use loops, streaming) against
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` — verify the proxy passes these through (hermes already
  uses the same endpoint in `anthropic_messages` mode).
- **Headless first-run**: presync seeds `~/.claude.json` flags; if the CLI adds
  new interactive gates, the bridge child may exit on start — check
  `journalctl -u claudecode` and `claude` stderr lines in the bridge log.

## Local Pi account startup

For a Pi using a normal Linux account, install Claude Code and run `claude auth login` as that account. Set `OS_AGENT_HOME` to its home and `OS_CONFIG_PATH` to the OS config file. The Claude workspace, user skills, login lookup, and gateway child use that home; unset variables retain the `/root` deployment defaults. Presync skips system-wide shell helpers for non-root users. Voice and vision still need their own configured providers.

`OS_AGENT_RUNTIME=claudecode scripts/dev/lamp-dev.sh start` selects `make claudecode-dev` on port 18791 instead of the Codex bridge. Set `OS_STATE_DIR` to a persistent writable directory and ensure Node/npm and Claude are on PATH. The web UI listens on the LAN and proxies API requests to port 5000. Failed tmux windows remain available for logs. This launcher still uses simulated HAL hardware.
