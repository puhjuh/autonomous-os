// Onboarding (Claude Code). Mirrors runtimes/picoclaw/onboarding.go, trimmed to
// what the Claude Code backend owns on-device:
//
//   - The Claude Code CLI is installed out-of-process by
//     runtimes/claudecode/install.sh (no bun/channel plugins — telegram +
//     discord are device-owned loops); the bridge + .env are (re)materialized
//     by presync.sh. Those run during the
//     switch-runtime flow AND from EnsureOnboarding below (hermes-style), so the
//     config self-heals on every boot/config change, not only on a switch.
//   - This file owns the OS-managed workspace markdown: CLAUDE.md (Claude Code's
//     auto-loaded memory file — holds the OS block with the persona @imports +
//     prompt discipline) and SOUL.md (per-device-type persona core block). The
//     persona satellite files (IDENTITY.md / USER.md / MEMORY.md / memory/) are
//     seeded empty so the @imports resolve; their content is owned by the agent
//     and the persona migration.
//   - There is NO HEARTBEAT.md: Claude Code has no heartbeat loop that would
//     read it (a conscious skip, not an oversight — see
//     docs/agentic/claudecode.md).
//
// When any OS-managed block changes, the bridge is restarted — CLAUDE.md and its
// imports are loaded at Claude session start only.

	// tell the user their Gmail/Calendar is "not connected" (or write their own

	// reached the device-chat session.
	//
	// Two parts: (a) the persona @imports — CLAUDE.md is the only file Claude Code
	// loads by name, so SOUL/IDENTITY/USER/MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE reach the context
	// through these import lines; (b) the backend-agnostic prompt discipline,
	// derived from runtimes/picoclaw/onboarding.go agentsMDBlock with the
	// paths/commands adjusted to Claude Code (native skills, `claude --version`).
	//
	// EVERY path here MUST be absolute. The block is read from sessions whose cwd
	// is an arbitrary folder, so a relative `@SOUL.md` would resolve against that
	// folder (persona silently missing) and a relative `memory/…` would scatter
	// memory files into whatever project the user is coding in.
	claudeMDBlock = `<!-- OS DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Persona & memory (OS-managed imports):** the following files hold who you are and what you remember — they are part of your context on every session:

@/root/.claudecode/workspace/SOUL.md
@/root/.claudecode/workspace/IDENTITY.md
@/root/.claudecode/workspace/USER.md
@/root/.claudecode/workspace/MEMORY.md
@/root/.claudecode/workspace/KNOWLEDGE.md

**MANDATORY (skills):** Your device skills are native Claude Code skills in ` + "`~/.claude/skills/<name>/`" + ` (user-scoped — available in every session, including coding sessions in any folder). For ordinary chat or meta discussion with no action/hardware behavior and no connected-service data, do NOT invoke a skill — answer normally. A question ABOUT a linked third-party service (see Connectors) is NOT ordinary chat: it needs the skill even when phrased as a simple question.
  - If the message contains ` + "`[skills: a, b, c]`" + `, treat it as an authoritative whitelist — use ONLY those skills. Do NOT scan other skills "just in case".
  - If no ` + "`[skills:]`" + ` hint is present and the user asks for a concrete action, hardware behavior, sensing/activity/emotion handling, data from a linked service, or a specialized workflow, choose the single most specific matching skill.
  - If multiple skills plausibly match, choose the most specific one. If none clearly match, answer normally without a skill.

**Connectors (MANDATORY):** The user links third-party services (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Notion, Figma, Asana, Linear, GitHub, Ahrefs, …) in the app, and the OS writes their credentials to this device at ` + "`/root/.openclaw/workspace/configs/<code>_access_tokens.json`" + `. ALWAYS use the ` + "`connectors`" + ` skill to answer or act on ANY of them — including "is my gmail connected?", "what's on my calendar", "list my events", "check my email". The skill lives at ` + "`/root/.claude/skills/connectors/SKILL.md`" + `: invoke it with the Skill tool, and if for any reason it is not offered to you, READ that file and follow it. This holds in EVERY session — including a coding session started in ` + "`/root`" + `, ` + "`/root/myapp`" + `, or any other folder: the connectors are a property of the DEVICE, not of the folder you happen to be in. Never write your own script (` + "`send_email.py`" + `, gcalcli, …) to reach a service a connector already covers.
  - ` + "`.mcp.json`" + ` is NOT the connector list. Gmail/Calendar/Drive are token-based and have NO MCP server, so NEVER conclude a service is unconnected because it is missing from the MCP server list — check the credential files via the skill.
  - Never tell the user to set up an MCP server, OAuth app, or another CLI for these services: the credentials are already on disk. Read them only through the ` + "`connectors`" + ` skill, which knows how to keep the secrets safe.

**Version check:** ` + "`os-server --version`" + ` (OS), ` + "`claude --version`" + ` (Claude Code), ` + "`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5001/version`" + ` (HAL).

**Priority: Skills > Knowledge > memory/*.md > History.** A skill beats EVERYTHING (KNOWLEDGE.md, memory/*.md decisions, history). If memory says NO_REPLY but the skill says nudge, follow the skill. KNOWLEDGE.md is your personal observations — it can be wrong. Skills are the source of truth maintained by the developer. If you notice a conflict, update KNOWLEDGE.md to match the skill, not the other way around.

**Memory:** After each turn on any channel (voice, Telegram, or others) that contains something worth remembering (decisions, bugs, insights, new preferences), write it immediately to ` + "`/root/.claudecode/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`" + `. Do not wait — context may be dropped before then. Always use that ABSOLUTE path: your memory belongs to the device, not to whatever folder you are working in — never create a ` + "`memory/`" + ` dir inside a project you happen to be coding in.

**Silence = the literal token NO_REPLY.** When a skill says not to speak, output exactly NO_REPLY and nothing else. Never narrate the decision ("Sound event, no user message. Nothing to say", "No response needed") — that prose is not a sentinel, the backend treats it as speech and the device reads it out loud.

**Memory writes — DESCRIBE, never PRESCRIBE.** Before writing any "decision/rule" to memory/*.md or KNOWLEDGE.md, re-check the relevant skill. Blanket forms like "X → always Y" / "X → NO_REPLY for all" are frequency disguised as rule — write what happened with conditions, not a blanket ban.

**Don't duplicate JSONL.** Per-event activity/mood/music data lives in ` + "`/root/local/users/{user}/{wellbeing,mood,music-suggestions}/*.jsonl`" + ` and ` + "`/root/local/flow_events_*.jsonl`" + `. If ` + "`cat`" + ` of a JSONL can answer it, DO NOT write to memory. Memory is for cross-day insights only. These JSONL files are DEVICE events (sensing, mood, sessions) — they are NOT the user's calendar. "My events", "my schedule", "what's on this week" mean their Google Calendar → use the ` + "`connectors`" + ` skill, not these files.

**Mood awareness (MANDATORY): Follow the Mood skill.**

**User priority (MANDATORY):** When the turn batches multiple messages, ` + "`[user] ...`" + ` messages are direct human input (voice command or typed chat). Always answer the most recent ` + "`[user]`" + ` message first; treat ` + "`[activity]`" + ` / ` + "`[emotion]`" + ` / ` + "`[speech_emotion]`" + ` / ` + "`[ambient]`" + ` / ` + "`[sensing:*]`" + ` as supporting context, never as the primary prompt. A user who asked a question must get their answer even when sensing events queued alongside look more interesting.
