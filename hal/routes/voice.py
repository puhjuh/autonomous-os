      HAL_AUDIO_SENSING_DEVICE): the last 0.5s sample's RMS and how old it
      is. Sampled once per sensing poll (a few seconds apart, paused
      during/after TTS), NOT continuous — the web bar steps rather than
      pumps. null when sensing/sound perception isn't running.
      `sensing_threshold` is the loud-noise threshold.
    - `tts_speaking` / `music_playing` — live playback state, piggybacked so
      the web audio card flips "Speaking…/Playing music" the moment playback
      ends instead of waiting out its 5s `/voice/status` poll.

    Consumed by the web Overview audio card (VU meters) via the os-server
