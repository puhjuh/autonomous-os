"""Servo follow worker for tracking — glides the arm toward a published goal.

The vision loop publishes an absolute 4-joint goal; a dedicated worker thread
glides toward it with a SmoothDamp critically-damped follower (ease-in /
ease-out), coalescing tiny intermediate setpoint changes. Decoupling the two
keeps the ViT tracker updating at full speed instead of ~halving fps waiting
for each servo command to finish. The follower owns the current-position state
for all 4 joints.

    Allocated against the travel each joint actually HAS in the direction being
    asked for, not by fixed weights alone. The weights still choose who goes
    first; a joint with no room contributes nothing and its share passes to a
    joint that can move.

    That distinction is the whole point, because the arm is badly asymmetric
    (see PITCH_TRAVEL_* in constants). Looking up, wrist_pitch has about 2 deg
    before it stalls; looking down it has about 65. A fixed weight has to pick
    one number for both, so it either wastes the wrist entirely or commands it
    into a stop. Gaze did the latter: it spent every correction on the wrist,
    `/servo/move` accepted the target unclamped, the servo answered
    `position error 14.6 deg (target=-49.0, actual=-34.4)`, and the head never
    lifted while the log cheerfully announced a correction every 10 seconds.

    Device-measured the same day with base and wrist pinned and only elbow
    moving: elbow +1.6 framed the desk, +54.8 framed the ceiling. Elbow is the
    strongest and freest joint upward, which is what its 0.90 weight encodes.

    travel_min / travel_max narrow a joint's usable range for this call only.
    Callers that can observe a joint failing to arrive use them to route around
    it — the measured limits below are static, but what a servo will actually
    deliver is not: the same elbow stalled at +17.4 and, after 60s of rest,
    reached +44 three times running.
