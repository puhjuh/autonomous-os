"""Mock motion driver — a body made of variables.

The whole stack has needed a robot to run. This is the smallest thing that
satisfies `MotionService` without hardware: joints are floats in a dict, moves
interpolate over their commanded duration the way the SDK-backed driver does,
and every call is recorded so a test (or a person poking HAL on a laptop) can
see exactly what the robot was told to do.

It is used by `robots/sim` (the mock body) together with `HAL_BOARD=sim`. It
is not a physics simulator: it models neither inertia nor collision. It does
replay the shipped CSV recordings in memory, through the same stretch-and-
resample timing the physical driver uses (hal/drivers/motors/recording_timing.py),
so a recording takes the same wall-clock time here as it does on a body.
