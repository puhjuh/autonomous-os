"""Speaker voice recognition service.

Stores per-user voice embeddings under ``/root/local/users/<name>/voice/`` and
recognizes speakers via cosine similarity. Embeddings are computed by a
configurable external API (see ``SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_API_URL``).

Audio preprocessing (Mono → Resample → [HighPass] → [NoiseReduce] → VAD →
[STOI gate] → RMS) runs ON THIS DEVICE (see ``audio_processors/``), next to the
mic. Only audio that passes the VAD + STOI intelligibility gate is uploaded; the
server is told to skip its own preprocessing (``preprocess=false``) and just
compute the embedding.

External API contract:
    POST {SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_API_URL}
    Headers: X-API-Key: {SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_API_KEY} (optional)
    Body:    {"audios_b64": ["<base64 WAV>", ...], "preprocess": false,
              "use_sliding_window": <bool>}
      ``use_sliding_window`` picks the chunking policy: false (enroll) embeds the
      whole utterance in a single shot; true (recognize) slides overlapping
      windows and returns the per-chunk matrix for voting.
    Response: {"embedding": [float, ...],            # 1-D aggregate, any dim
               "chunk_embeddings": [[float, ...]]}   # [M, D], only when
                                                     # use_sliding_window=true

A speaker is stored as a BANK of per-sample embeddings — one row per WAV, never
averaged together. Retrieval takes the max over a speaker's rows, mirroring the
face pipeline (``faceid/recognizer.py``). Averaging was removed because it made
every sample able to damage every other: one bad clip shifted the single stored
vector, so samples had to be filtered and deleted to protect the mean, and a
merge decision could not be undone.

Two tiers per user, kept separate exactly as face keeps uploads vs extended:

* **anchor** — audio the user deliberately enrolled. Permanent; no automatic
  path prunes or deletes it.
* **extended** — auto-captured: unknown-cluster audio claimed at enroll time,
  plus confidently-recognized later turns. Capped and diversity-pruned.

Storage layout per user::

    /root/local/users/<norm>/
        metadata.json           — SHARED identity (telegram_username, telegram_id,
                                   display_name). Same file face-enroll writes —
                                   merged on write, never overwritten blindly.
        voice/
            metadata.json       — voice-specific (enrolled_at, updated_at,
                                   num_samples, sample_files, embedding_dim)
            sample_<origin>_<ts>_<uuid>.wav  — anchor WAV (16kHz mono)
            sample_<origin>_<ts>_<uuid>.npy  — its L2-normalized embedding [D]
            .extended/
                ext_<ts>_<seq>.wav           — auto-captured sample
                ext_<ts>_<seq>.npy           — its embedding [D]
            embedding.npy       — LEGACY aggregated vector. No longer written;
                                   still READ as a one-row bank so profiles from
                                   before the rewrite keep matching.

Label normalization matches :class:`FaceRecognizer.normalize_label` so face /
voice / mood / wellbeing all share the same per-user folder for a person.

#
# Each node also carries `self_ms` (its own time minus its children's), so the
# cost of a parent's own glue is visible rather than hidden in the total.
#
# MEMORY. RSS is SAMPLED on a background thread (~20 ms) for the life of the
# call, and each stage reports the PEAK seen inside its own window. Endpoint-only
# sampling — read RSS at entry, read it again at exit — was the original approach
# and it is wrong for this pipeline: RSS moves only when the allocator asks the
# OS for pages or returns them, so a stage that allocates and frees within its
# own window reports 0.0, and a stage that happens to run when an earlier
# allocation is released reports a NEGATIVE cost. Real traces showed exactly
# that — `stoi_gate` at 1.7 s of ONNX inference reporting 0.00 MB on one call
# and -28.62 MB on the next. So three numbers are kept, each answering a
# different question:
#
#   rss_peak_delta_mb   peak-during-stage minus RSS at entry — "what did this
#                       stage cost at its worst". THIS is the memory number to
#                       read; it survives allocate-then-free.
#   rss_end_delta_mb    exit minus entry — "what did it keep". Legitimately
#                       negative when the allocator hands pages back.
#   rss_peak_mb         absolute high-water RSS during the stage.
#
# Caveat that no RSS-based method escapes: RSS is PROCESS-wide, so a concurrent
# HAL thread allocating during a stage lands in that stage's numbers. Sampling
# widens that exposure (it sees every spike in the window, not just the
# endpoints) in exchange for catching transient peaks at all. Read a single
# stage's memory as an upper bound, and prefer the shape across several calls.
#
# CPU. `cpu_ms` is process CPU time (`time.process_time()`) across the whole
# process, which is what catches the ONNX/torch intra-op thread pools — the
# work that makes `stoi_gate` expensive. `cpu_pct` is cpu_ms/wall_ms*100, so
# >100% means it used more than one core and ~0% means it was blocked, not
# working (`embed_api.request` should sit near zero — it is waiting on the
# network). `thread_cpu_ms` is the calling thread alone, so the gap between it
# and `cpu_ms` is roughly what the pools did. Both are process-wide in the same
# way RSS is: another busy HAL thread inflates `cpu_ms`.
#
# The RSS source is recorded as `rss_source`, because it changes what a delta means:
#
#   "psutil" / "statm"  CURRENT RSS — the accurate case (on-device Linux, and
#                       any box with psutil). A delta can be NEGATIVE when the
#                       allocator hands pages back.
#   "rusage"            HIGH-WATER RSS (ru_maxrss) — the macOS-without-psutil
#                       fallback. Monotonic, so deltas are growth-only: a stage
#                       reports > 0 only when it pushed the process past its
#                       previous peak. Good enough to spot which stage owns the
#                       footprint, useless for measuring memory being released.
#
# Repeated stages (enroll embeds many samples) are summed, with `calls` and
# `ms_max` alongside.
